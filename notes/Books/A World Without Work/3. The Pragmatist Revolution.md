The most capable systems today are not designed like that, rather than are grown organically. Evolution is exactly like this, where the complexity of human anatomy has developed over millions of years, rather than been created by an intelligent being.

This idea plays into the development of automation. In the book, two approaches to the development of AI are explained through development of machines that compete against humans in chess and Go.

The early efforts in this were based around teaching the machines how to play the game by having grand masters teach them. The machines would approach the game the same way a human player would, by calculating a number of possible moves into the future. This was possible in chess, but would be difficult in Go because the number of possible moves was too high. This approach was about teaching it to win.

The later approach was quite different. Instead of teaching the machine to win, it was taught to play. The machines were taught all the rules of the game, and then played many games against themselves.
