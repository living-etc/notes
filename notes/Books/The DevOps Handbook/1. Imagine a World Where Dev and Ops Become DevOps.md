DevOps is needed in order to solve the problems of dysfunctional IT/Technology departments being uable to delivery the value the business needs or expects. QA and security only happen after the software is already completed and it's too late to correct any problems found. Developers build software that is not operationally fit for purpose, leaving operations to burn their people in hellish on-call rotas to keep it running. Overall, the quality of software produced is low, resulting in the business being dissatisfied with the performance of IT, resulting in budget cuts.
