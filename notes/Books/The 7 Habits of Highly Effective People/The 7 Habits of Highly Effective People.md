# 1. For lasting change, you have to address your character, not your behavior

There are two ways to improve yourself. One is to learn the skills of the person you want to be, and the other is to mould your character into the person you want to be. The first is just a shortcut, a self-improvement get-rich-quick scheme that won't last in the long run since your true character will always shine through.

That last point is why changing your character is so important. If you only learn the skills, you're not changing yourself, you're only pretending to be someone else. Self-improvement is about becoming a better version of yourself, and this involves changing who you are.

# 2. Align your way of seeing the world with basic universal principles

A paradigm is a way in which we see the world, and in order to be successful in life, we need to shift our paradigm to one that is aligned with universal principles like honesty, fairness and integrity. Since most people agree that these are good things, we can think of them as a set of natural laws. The more our paradigms reflect these natural laws, the greater our chances of success in attaining lasting change.

# 3. The first habit: be proactive and take control of your own fate.

The biggest things that separates humans from animals is how we respond to external stimuli. An animal can only react to it in the way its brain has been pre-programmed. Humans, on the other hand, have the ability to reflect on a stimulus before responding. Thus, we can choose how we respond to it, thus being proactive in how we interact with the world around us.

We all have two concentric circles in our lives. The outer circle is our circle of concern, where everything we worry about resides. Within that is our circle of influence, which encompasses the things we worry about over which we have control. Proactive people focus their energies on their circle of influence, and in doing so are often able to expand that circle. Reactive people focus their energy and attention on their circle of concern, where they are unable to exert any influence or control. This is what the Stoics call the [[Dichotomy of Control]].

We can decide what happens in the gap between a stimulus and response.

# 4. The second habit: begin with the end in mind

The more exact and realistic the mental image of the act, the better its execution will be. If you're building a house, without a clear plan of the finish building, you risk making such mistakes as forgetting to put the stairs in.

My comment:

> Something to bear in mind here is that this does not advocate for massive upfront planning in all things. Constructing a building is a place where you would want complete upfront planning, but other endeavors such as most things in life, require less of a plan and more of a vision. You set a direction of travel, take a step, stop, evaluate and course-correct.

# 5. The second habit continued: write a personal mission statement and integrate it into your daily life.

Being efficient means getting the most done in the least time. This can mean climbing a ladder up the wrong wall. Being effective, on the other hand, means having your ladder against the right wall.

The [[Personal Mission Statement]] gives you a personal constitution against which you can align your actions. A useful way of coming up with such a document is to imagine what you want people to say about you at your funeral, and work back from there.

# 6. The third habit: put first things first

This means rigorously prioritizing the most important things so the most important are always at the top. An easy way of doing this is to prioritize all tasks against a 2x2 matrix of urgency vs importance.

The tasks that are important but not urgent are the ones that will make the most difference to our lives. Tasks such as building important relationships and planning for the future are found here.

Of the other tasks:

- important and urgent are the crises
- urgent but not important are things like a phone ringing while you're working on something else
- not important and not urgent are the time wasters

# 7. The fourth habit: think win-win

Approaching interactions with people or parties with a win-win attitude results in lasting positive relationship and creation of mutual trust. This is because a mutually beneficial outcome will be remembered by the other party in future interactions, leading to a stronger relationship over time.

# 8. The fourth habit continued: forming stable relationships with others means investing in emotional bank accounts

Several major deposits you can make:

- Maintain the utmost personal integrity - be loyal to people not present, and don't badmouth them or reveal what they've told you in confidence.
- Always keep promises
- Be explicit about what you expect of the other person
- Be courteous and sensitive even in small matters
- Really trying to understand other people, allowing you to discover what's important to them, so you can learn what counts as a deposit for them

If you have to make a withdrawal from the account, apologize up front. People are often happy to forgive a repentant sinner.

# 9. The fifth habit: seek first to understand, then to be understood

Need to develop the skill of empathic listening

- listening not to provide an answer
- listening to understand the person in front of you

The words we say accounts for 10% of our communication, sounds 30%, body language 60%.

## 9.1. Actions

Observe a conversation without hearing the words. Takes time and effort to master this skill, but the rewards are worth it.

# 10. The sixth habit: synergize by treating others with openness and respect

Synergy is the idea that the total output by a group is greater than the sum of the individual contributions by its members. In order for a group to be synergised, a lot of time must be taken for the group to get to know each other so that, when disagreements happen, they can be discussed, and a solution amicable to the group can be found. This is instead of disagreements breading opposition.

## 10.1. Actions

Make a list of people you find it difficult to discuss things with and think about their views. If you were more confident and open minded, do you could find synergy between your perspective and theirs? Lucy.

# 11. The seventh habit: sharpen the saw if you want to keep swiping

> If a lumberjack spent all their time cutting down trees and not sharpening their saw, they would soon have a dull saw and wouldn't be able to cur down a single tree.

You need to look after yourself in order to stay effective and maintain the habits you've developed. There are four areas of health you need to focus on:

- Physical health - exercise and diet
- Spiritual health - meditation and self reflection
- Mental health - read good books, spend less time in front of the TV and make time for your own writing.
- Social health - work on building relationships

# 12. Final summary

- Be proactive
- Begin with an end in mind
- Put first things first
- Think win-win
- Seek first to understand, then be understood
- Synergize
- Sharpen the saw
