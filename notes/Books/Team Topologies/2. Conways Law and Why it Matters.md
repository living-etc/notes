Why Does Conways Law Matter?
    
    Conways Law states that the design of a system will mirror the communication patterns within the organisation. A system built by a frontend team, backend team, middleware team and database team will consist of distinct frontend, backend, middleware and database components.
    
How can we use Conways Law to our advantage?
    
    We can lean into Conways Law in what's called a reverse conway manoeuvre, where the organisation structures itself in such a way as to achieve the desired system architecture.
