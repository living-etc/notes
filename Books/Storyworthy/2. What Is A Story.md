A story is about the storyteller. It is a way for them to express their most authentic truth, to be vulnerable to the audience, and this is what people want to hear their stories. Fables and folktales might be entertaining, but they don't allow the audience to connect with the storyteller.

There are a few requirements for a good story:
- **Change**. A good story must illustrate some change in you over time, no matter how large. A story without change is an anecdote, illustrating a storyworthy event in your life that was memorable enough to talk about but left no lasting impact on you. There's nothing wrong with telling such a fable, but people won't connect with you. They are the cotton-candy of storytelling - delicious but forgettable.
- **Your story only**. Your friend might have had a great experience that changed their life, but the audience won't connect with you if you tell that story. There's something real about hearing a story about someone sat across from you.
- **The Dinner Test**. The story you tell on a stage in front of a professional audience should be the same one you tell over dinner to a close friend. It shouldn't sound rehearsed or over-dramatic, performancey or inauthentic The audience will think of you as a regular human being.
