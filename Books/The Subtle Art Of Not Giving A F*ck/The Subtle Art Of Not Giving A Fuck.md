# Summary in three sentences
1. Money can't neither buy happiness, nor things that make you happy, because true happiness isn't a destination, it's a never-ending journey that is nothing but struggle.
2. Who we are is defined by what we are willing to struggle for - an athlete chooses to struggle in the gym, a devoted parent struggles to raise their child, and what we are willing to struggle for is defined by our values.
3. Good values lead to the struggles that ultimately make us happy, a value that is: evidence based, not emotion-based; socially constructive as opposed to socially destructive; and immediate and within our control instead of being dependent on external events in the future.

# Who Should Read It?
Anyone who is thinking to themselves "how do I be happy?".

# How the Book Changed Me
This book didn't change my life, it saved it.

Throughout my life, I've never acted with any kind of purpose, never deliberately, though I never realised that until I read this book. Each time the author described problematic behaviour that led people to be miserable and depressed, I couldn't think anything beside "yep, that's me". I felt very seen reading this book.

I've struggled with the question of "how do I be happy" quite a lot in the last few years (writing this at the end of 2020) and I didn't know where to go or what to do. This book answered that question perfectly for me.

I feel like I can finally start living.

# My Top Three Quotes
1. Who you are is defined by what you’re willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who run triathlons and have chiseled abs and can bench-press a small house.
2. Happiness is a constant work-in-progress, because solving problems is a constant work-in-progress—the solutions to today’s problems will lay the foundation for tomorrow’s problems, and so on. True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.
3. The only way to be comfortable with death is to understand and see yourself as something bigger than yourself; to choose values that stretch beyond serving yourself, that are simple and immediate and controllable and tolerant of the chaotic world around you. This is the basic root of all happiness.
