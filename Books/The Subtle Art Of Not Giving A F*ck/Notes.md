### Part 1: What is happiness?

When someone says money can't buy happiness, but it can buy things that make you happy, go ahead and send them a copy of Mark Manson's book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck so they can understand why they're wrong.

When we do something that we think will make us happy, such as buying things, we get a temporary high before our brain adjusts to the new normal and we start pursuing something else. This is called a Hedonic Treadmill, where we keep doing or doing or acquiring things that we think will make us happy without actually getting any happier.

Philosopher Allan Watts defined what he called the Backwards Law, where pursuing positive experiences is actually a negative experience while pursuing negative experiences is a positive experience. This is because pursing something only reinforces the fact you lack it in the first place.

People who pursue things that they think will make them happy are only reminded each day of their sadness, and when they reach their goal the happiness is only temporary before fading away.

On the other hand, people who endure burning muscles in the gym are the ones who run triathlons and aspiring artists who endure the ridicule and humiliation of their peers whenever they publish their work are the ones who eventually get noticed.

People who excel in sports only do so because they enjoy the process of getting their body into the shape needed to complete. Successful artists are so because they enjoy the process of expressing themselves through their art. **Our success is defined not by what we achieve, but by what we're willing to endure to achieve it**. Achievement is a side effect of enjoying what you do, not the goal of it, and we enjoy the thing we do when we have good values.

Good values are: evidence-based; socially-constructive; and immediate and within our control. Honesty is an example of a good value, since you know you are being honest, it has a positive effect on our relationship with others since it builds trust, and you only have to decide to be honest for it to be true.

Bad values, on the other hand, are superstitious, socially-destructive and outside of our control or not immediate. Popularity is an example of bad values. You can't tell if people truly like you, you can only guess (superstitious), trying to impress people can lead you do to the wrong thing (socially-destructive) and the effects aren't immediate or within your control, since you can't make people like you.

To understand why we have bad values and how we can develop good ones, we must cut through the three layers of self-discovery of the Self-Awareness Onion. The first layer is understanding what things make you happy or sad, a simple cause and effect relationship, the second layer is understanding why these emotions are elicited in these situations, and the third is why we consider these situations a personal success or failure.

Our emotions are a feedback system signaling success or failure at something. To really understand why we have the values we do, and thus change them, we need to peel away the layers of our soul to discover the rotten parts that cause us to have bad values. These are usually events that happened to us in our childhood that we don't realize are influencing our behavior today.

Some form of therapy, either sat on a sofa in front of a professional or self-therapy like journaling, is usually needed to move path the first layer, and we're mot going to enjoy that journey. Facing off against these problems is one of the emotionally harrowing thing most of us will have to do, but it's a struggle that paves the way to becoming better versions of ourselves. Any attempt at self-improvement carried out at the second layer fails to solve the underlying problems, and at the first layer it's purely superficial (most New Years resolutions happen here).

Self-improvement at the third layer is solving the root cause of our problems, some we might not even be aware of, and it's solving these problems that we will ultimately develop good values which, ultimately, make us happy.

### Part 2: Five examples of good values

1. **Always be responsible, even when you're not at fault**. We can't control the circumstances by which problems enter our lives, but we can control how we respond to them. Life is like a game of poker where each player is dealt a random hand of cards. Some people get dealt a bad hand at birth, others are dealt it later in life. As with poker, the outcome of the game is little to do with the hand people are given and everything to do with the decisions of the players. A good poker player with a bad hand can beat a bad player with a good hand, and in life people who achieve the most are the ones who make the best possible decisions in spite of the hand they've been dealt.
2. **Cultivate doubt in everything**. Our minds are very good at applying meaning to the things we experience, and they usually get it wrong. Our minds are full of imperfections and bias, so any meaning it generates will likewise be imperfect. We must therefore assume that everything we know is wrong, and when we learn something, we just become less wrong, rather than becoming right. This leaves us infinite opportunity for growth, where complete certainty would close all those doors. When we are completely certain about our righteousness, we leave ourselves open to the sort of entitlement that justifies cheating and hurting people to get what we want, because we *know* we deserve it. Doubt can be cultivated with three questions to ask when we feel upset about something:
    1. What if I'm wrong?
    2. What would it mean if I were wrong?
    3. Would being wrong create better or worse problems than my current problem, for both myself and others?
3. **Embrace pain to achieve success**. People who are good at something are only so because they've failed at it multiple times, but a lot of people are afraid of failure because they associate it with pain. Quite often this is because of bad values and/or bad metrics for those values, where being unsuccessful is a painful failure. To get out of this mindset we must re-orient our values around the idea of failure being a success, since this means we're taking one step closer to being better, which we can do with better values. The idea of not taking action until we know it will generate the right outcome is what keeps us stuck in place, because we think achieving results is a linear process:
    - Inspiration → Motivation → Desirable Result

    This is incorrect. The process is in fact a loop, where each cycle feeds into the next:

    - Inspiration → Motivation → Undesirable Result → Inspiration → Motivation → Slightly Less Undesirable Result → Etc

    We can't achieve a desirable result without first achieving many undesirable results and using them to calibrate our direction of travel, and we can't start with process without taking that very first action. It doesn't matter what this action is, since its outcome will always be useful in determining what to do next.

4. **Find freedom through rejection**. In order to bring a value into our lives, we must reject all things in the world that are counter to that value. Someone who does not reject anything is trying to keep everyone else happy, in order to avoid conflict. Conflict is a challenge that makes people feel uncomfortable, and some would rather put on different faces for different people than be themselves and reject some of these people. Someone who does this values nothing, because they reject nothing, and their life is shallow and superficial.

    They might be people who move from country to country, never settling down, or they might move from job to job, or from lover to lover. This is a fear of commitment, a fear of rejecting the options available to them and settling for one. These options, however. are all just highs, and like all highs you become resistant to them the more you indulge.

    There's a special kind of experience that you can only get by committing to a single thing for a long period of time: living in one place for five years, the same partner for ten years. If you can say "I'm missing out on opportunities, and I don't care because what I have is enough", then you free yourself from the fear of missing out and chasing those highs.

5. **Remember you're going to die one day**. The question of whether or not our values are good depends on whether or not we have accepted the impermanence of our existence. Everyone is driven by an existential dread called [[Death Terror]] and, whether we realize it or not, all of our efforts, in one way of another, go into attempting to preserve our legacy after we die.

    Those who accept the inevitability of death accept their temporary role in a world that was here before they arrived and will still be here after their gone. These people then decide how they are going to make it a slightly better place for those who follow.

    Those who don't accept their eventual death fail to consider themselves as only passing through the world. They instead live at the centre of their own world, surrounded by problems they think are the worst anyone has. The entitlement that comes with this mindset leads them to adopt destructive values in an effort to forever feel good about themselves.

    The root of real happiness is to accept you are a temporary blip on the radar of the world that will fade in a cosmological moment. Once you do, you can leave your legacy behind in a constructive way, but choosing values that go beyond serving yourself, that make you the servant to whoever is coming after you.
