The future of work depends on two forces: a harmful substituting force and a helpful complementing force. Most stories have a hero and a villain fighting each other, but here technology is playing both roles at once, simultaneously displacing workers while increasing the demands for their services elsewhere in the economy.

This does not mean, however, that workers displaced by automation can pick up the jobs created elsewhere in the economy as blue-collar manual workers are being displaced but demand is increasing for white-collar cognitive workers. This is called **frictional technological unemployment**.

There are three types of mismatch preventing workers moving into the in-demand jobs:
- **skills mismatch** - the in-demand jobs require higher skills than displaced workers possess.
- **identity mismatch** - many displaced workers are either taking up work that is below their skill level, or are opting out of work altogether rather than take up "pink collar work", a derogatory term for those jobs still performed by humans that are typically done by women.
