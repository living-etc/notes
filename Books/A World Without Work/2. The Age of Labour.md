Economists idea of the value of labour has always derived from the idea of skilled vs unskilled work, where the skill refers to the level of formal education someone has. This idea was challenged by the ALM hypothesis which shifted the conversation from a job bias to a task bias. The job-biased model considered each job as a single unit, where doctors did doctoring and lawyers did lawyering. The ALM hypothesis moved the conversation to a model where each job is composed of a number of tasks that are very different in nature, and it's these tasks that are being automated.

A trap techno optimists fall into is to say that the only job that has been eliminated from the job market is elevator operator, and that all the other jobs are safe, but in reality each job has many tasks that can be automated.
