When economists think about the type of skills needed to perform a task, they describe them in terms like "manual", "cognitive", etc, but this in with respect to how humans perform the task. As we've already seen, robots are able to perform tasks that people previously considered un-automatable by doing them quite differently.

When thinking about the automatability of a job, it's important to not only think about the nature of the work (routine or not) but the cost of automation. Human workers doing routine work might still be more economical to employ than an expensive machine. This links back to the origin of the term "luddite", where the cotton workers rebelling against the automation of their trade were actually highly skilled, and would likely have been members of powerful guilds. The goal of automating the cotton trade was to make it so a large number of skilled workers could be replaced with a smaller number of unskilled workers.
