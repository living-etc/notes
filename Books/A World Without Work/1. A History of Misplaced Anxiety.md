title: Summary

There are two forces at play in the relationship between machines that automate a job and the people who do that job. One is a substituting force that sees people replaced by the machine, and the other is a complimenting one that sees the machine enhance the person doing the job.

As ATMs were being rolled out in the US, one might expect the number of people employed as tellers would drop as the machines displaced them. In fact the oposite happened, where the number of teller employer rose during the same period, sometimes by as much as 20%.

ATMs complimented the tellers directly, by freeing them up to offer better face to face support to customers, driving more footfall into the branch. At the same time, automation was driving improvements in the economy, making people more propsperous. Both of these increased demand for banking services, causing more branches to be opened, causing more tellers to be employed.
