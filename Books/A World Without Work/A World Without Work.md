## Part 1: The Context
There are two ideas that are found at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence research and Economics. The first idea, held by AI researchers, states that only an Artificial General Intelligence would be a true reflection of human intelligence in a machine, and any machine that is able to perform tasks algorithmicaly is nothing more than an "expensive alarm clock". 

The second idea is known as the ALM Hypothesis, and it is used to explain the hollowing out of the labour market in the mid to late twentieth century, where those on the low and high end of the skill scale were flourishing while those in the middle were being automated out of a job. This hypothesis explained this phenomenon by challenging the "job-bias" of economic thinking of the time they thought of each profession only as a singular object, where lawyers did lawyering, doctors did doctoring, etc. This thinking lead to the assumption that certain jobs were safe from automation because a machine couldn't do "lawyering".

The ALM hypothesis challenges this top-down thinking by proposing a bottom-up task-bias instead, describing each job as a collection of tasks, some of which were more automatable than others. It proposed the idea of "routine work" as being easy to automated, routine being defined as easy to explain the rules to someone else so they can do it. This articulation of the rules for completing a certain task was thought to be the limiting factor in the automatability of a task. This notion was eventually disproven by the success of chess and go-playing computers.

Early computers designed to play chess were designed in the understanding that in order to win a game of chess, one must learn from an expert in the game. Thus, the play styles of grand master were studied and taught to the machines, based primarily on the idea of a chess player thinking X number of potential moves ahead. The computers were able to calculate all possible moves and use probability to make the moves most likely to achieve victory. This didn't scale to Go, however, since the number of potential moves were far too great for the computers to process.

This changed with the advent of the "pragmatic revolution". Researchers built a computer called AlphaGo, which successfully won games of Go against champions not by learning from human games, but by learning from itself. Researchers programmed it only with the rules of the game, and it then played millions of games against itself, studying the results and formulating its own strategy with which it disproved the notion that Go was too complicated for a machine to win, and that only a human was capable of it.

AlphaGo winning the game wasn't as important, however, as how it won it. During turn 37 of the second game, AlphaGo made a move that no human player would have done. It was considered a strategic blunder within the lore of the game, and one commentator described feeling physically sick, which another described it as not human. AlphoGo had rewritten the rules of the game and used them to win.

The thinking around the automation of tasks has been root in, and limited by, human understanding of those tasks. Whether or not a task could be automated was understood to be based on whether or not a human could teach a machine the rule for performing it. This thinking did not account for the idea of machines teaching themselves a new set of rules for performing tasks.

Human believe ourselves to the pinnacle of nature, to be the most advanced machine in existence to which there is no equal. This hubris has lead us to underestimate the capability of machines, who are on the verge of, if not already, overtaking us in certain areas.
