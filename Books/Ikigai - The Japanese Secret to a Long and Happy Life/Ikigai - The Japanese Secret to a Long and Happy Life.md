## Stress: Accused of killing longevity
High levels of prolonged stress are bad for us in the long term, shortening our life and generally making us less happy and pleasant day-to-day.

Stress, however, isn't an inherintly bad thing. The problem is the sort of stress that causes us to be in a perpetual state of reacting to danger, the fight or flight response.

A good form of stress is the low-level stress that comes from being challanged by work you are enjoying.

## Ways to reduce stress
- Walk to work, or just go for a walk
	- for at least 20 minutes each day
- Use your feet instead of an elevator or escalator
	- good for posture, muscales and respiratory system
- Participate in social or leisure activities
	- so you don't spend too much time in front of the TV
- Replace your junk food with fruit
	- you'll have less of an urge to snack, and more nutrients in your system
- Get the right amount of sleep
	- Seven to nine hours is good, but any more than that makes us lethergic
- Play with children or pets, or join a sports team
	- this not only strengthens your body but also stimulates the mind and boost self-esteem.
- Be conscious of your daily routine
	- in order to detect harmful habits and repace them with more positive ones

## Anti-aging attitude
Research has found that having a positive attitude and a high degree of emotional awareness correlates with a longer, happier life. Those who face challenges with a positive outlook and are able to manage their emotions are already well on their way to longevity.

A stoic attitude (serenity in the face of setback) can also help keep you young as it lowers anxiety and stress levels.
