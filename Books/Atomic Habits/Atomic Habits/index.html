<h2 id="chapter-summary">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Habits are the compound interest of self improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run.</li>
<li>Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you, or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential.</li>
<li>Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.</li>
<li>An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.</li>
<li>If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-notes">Other Notes</h2>
<p>The development of bad habits can be related to the shrinking of the comfort zone over time. The longer you wallow in the centre of your comfort zone, the more you build up the habits that are keeping you there. The bad habits are like concrete slowly solidifying and holding you in your comfort zone.</p>
<p>The foundation of getting good results in life is the aggregation of marginal gains. Making small improvements in your life, and maintaining them, adds up to something great over time. In order to achieve in life, you should focus on the trajectory rather than the destination. For example, instead of focusing on loosing weight, focus instead on being fit and healthy, and the habits that lead to such a life.</p>
<p>When the world looks at successful people, they only see the success. They don’t see the years of work that lead up to that success. The world thinks these people were successful overnight. It’s the same as judging one’s life by someone else’s Instagram or Facebook feeds, which are only a highlight reel of someone’s life. They don’t include the boring bits, or the bad bits. Because of this, many people quit working on their habits when they fail to see tangible results quick enough. In fact, it takes a long time to see those results, but when they appear, it can look from the outside like overnight success.</p>
<p>It’s more important to focus on the system that will help you reach a goal, rather than on the goal itself. For example, the Nike principles from the 80s include something like “If we do the right thing, we make money automatic”. There’s another one that says “Do a good job, and success will find you”. The quote in this chapter is about sports games: “The score takes care of itself”. If you want to run a marathon, focus on being a good athlete. If you want to write a book, focus on being a writer. If a team wants to win a game, focus on playing well. Goals set the direction, but the systems is what makes the progress.</p>
<p>Focusing on the goals can lead to some problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Losers have the same goals<ol>
<li>People who achieve an ambitious goals are the ones the world sees. It doesn’t see all the other people who failed to achieve the same goal.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.<ol>
<li>You might clean you room, but unless you change the habits that lead to it becoming messy in the first place, it’ll only get messy again.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Goals restrict happiness<ol>
<li>Don’t think “I’ll be happy once I’ve run a marathon”. That could takes years to achieve. Instead think, “I’m happy because I’m an athlete”, which is something you can achieve today by starting training.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Goals are at odds with long term progress<ol>
<li>If you focus on the goal, you might stop once you reach it, losing your progress.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<h1 id="2-how-habits-shape-your-identity-and-vice-versa">2. How Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-summary_1">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change and identity change.</li>
<li>The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve but on who you wish to be.</li>
<li>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.</li>
<li>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</li>
<li>The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-notes_1">Other notes</h2>
<p>Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about achieving certain goals like losing weight. Habits can help with that, but fundamentally they’re not about having something, they’re about becoming someone. Quite literally, you become your habits.</p>
<p>Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we want to become.</p>
<p>Your identity emerges out of your habits. The more you repeat a certain behaviour, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behaviour. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.</p>
<p>True behaviour change is identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with it is because it becomes a part of your identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader</li>
<li>The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner</li>
<li>The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</li>
</ul>
<p>Behaviour that is not congruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates then you’ll continue to be pulled towards spending rather than earning.</p>
<h1 id="3-how-to-build-better-habits-in-4-simple-steps">3. How to build better habits in 4 simple steps</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-summary_2">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>A habit is a behaviour that is repeated enough times to become automatic</li>
<li>The ultimate purpose of a habit is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.</li>
<li>Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, reward.</li>
<li>The Four Laws of Behaviour Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits:<ul>
<li>Makes it obvious (Cue)</li>
<li>Make it attractive (Craving)</li>
<li>Make it easy (Response)</li>
<li>Make it satisfying (Reward)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-notes_2">Other Notes</h2>
<p>When a habit is forming, mental activity in the brain is high as it analyses the problem and comes up with a solution. The more you repeat this process the less activity there is in the brain is it locks in the process of solving the problem. A habit is a mental shortcut learned from experience.</p>
<p>Good habits give us the freedom to life live. Someone with good financial habits doesn’t have to worry about saving money, whereas someone with bad habits is always worrying about the next pound and living pay check to pay check.</p>
<p>The process of forming habits can be divided into four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cue<ol>
<li>Triggers your brain to initiate a behaviour. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Craving<ol>
<li>Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit.</li>
<li>What you crave is not the habit, but the change in state it delivers. A smoker craves the nicotine hit, rather than the act of smoking itself. Every craving is linked to a desire to change an internal state.</li>
<li>Cravings differ from one person to the next. They are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings and emotions of an observer will transform a cue into a craving.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Response<ol>
<li>The response is the habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Reward<ol>
<li>End end goal of the habit</li>
<li>The cue is about noticing the reward, the craving is about wanting the reward and the response is about obtaining the reward.</li>
<li>First purpose of reward is to satisfy craving</li>
<li>Second purpose is to teach us which actions are worth remembering for the future</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle. If a behaviour is insufficient in any of these four steps, it will not become a habit. Without the first three steps, a behaviour will not occur. Without all four, it will not be repeated. A cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward which satisfies the craving and becomes associated with the cue.</p>
<p>These four steps can be split into two phases. The problem phase includes the cue and craving, while the solution phase includes the response and reward. All behaviour is driven by a desire to solve a problem.</p>

<ul>
<li>Without enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.</li>
<li>Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.</li>
<li>The process of behaviour change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.</li>
<li>Pointing-and-calling raises your level of awareness fri a non conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalising your actions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behaviour over time.</li>
<li>Every habit is limited by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.</li>
<li>Make the cues of a good habit obvious in your environment.</li>
<li>Gradually, your habit become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behaviour. The context becomes the cue.</li>
<li>It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against the old cues.</li>

<li>Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.</li>
<li>People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.</li>
<li>One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.</li>
<li>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long term one.</li>

<ul>
<li>The 2nd Law of behaviour change is make it attractive.</li>
<li>The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.</li>
<li>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.</li>
<li>It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfilment of it - that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.</li>
<li>Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</li>

<h2 id="chapter-summary_8">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>The culture we live in determines which behaviours are attractive to us.</li>
<li>We tend to adopt habits that are praised or approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.</li>
<li>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).</li>
<li>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</li>
<li>The normal behaviour of the tribe often overpowers the desired behaviour of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</li>
<li>If a behaviour car get us approval, respect and praise, we find it attractive.</li>

<ul>
<li>The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behaviour Change is make it unattractive.</li>
<li>Every behaviour has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive.</li>
<li>Your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires.</li>
<li>The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling.</li>
<li>Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.</li>
<li>Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.</li>

<li>The 3rd Law of behaviour Change is make it easy</li>
<li>The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning</li>
<li>Focus on taking action, not being in motion</li>
<li>Habit formation is the process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.</li>
<li>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="12-the-law-of-least-effort">12. The Law of Least Effort</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-summary_11">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Human behaviour follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate towards the option that requires the least amount of work.</li>
<li>Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.</li>
<li>Reduce the friction associated with good behaviours. When friction is low, habits are easy.</li>
<li>Increase the friction associated with the bad behaviours. When friction is high, habits are difficult.</li>
<li>Prime your environment to make future actions easier.</li>

<h2 id="chapter-summary_12">Chapter Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behaviour for minutes or hours afterward.</li>
<li>Many habits occur at decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road - and either send you in a direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.</li>
<li>The Two-Minute Rule states “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do”.</li>
<li>The more you ritualise the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.</li>
<li>Standardise before you optimise. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.</li>

<ul>
<li>The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behaviour Change is make it difficult.</li>
<li>A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behaviour in the future.</li>
<li>The ultimate way to lock in future behaviour is to automate your habits.</li>
<li>Onetime choices - like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan - are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing return over time.</li>
<li>Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behaviour.</li>
