<blockquote>
<p>Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating
-- John Cleese</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it's true that you don't find your audience, that they instead find you, it's also true that you have to be finable by the audience.</p>
<p>This book is about making yourself findable.</p>
<h1 id="1-you-dont-have-to-be-a-genius">1. You Don't Have To Be A Genius</h1>
<h2 id="find-a-scenius">Find a Scenius</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Give what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare think.
-- Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creativity doesn't happen in a vacuum from a lone individual secluded away in their studio, it instead comes from a scene of people learning from each other. It's not an antisocial act, like the myth of the lone creative genius, rather it's a very social act.</p>
<p>Being a valuable member of the scenius isn't about what you derive from it, rather it's about what you contribute to it, the connections you make and the conversations you start. Everyone, including the amateur on their first day, has the ability to contribute something.</p>
<h2 id="be-an-amateur">Be an Amateur</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>That's all any of us are: amateurs. We don't live long enough to be anything else.
-- Charlie Chaplin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being an amateur means you are free to make mistakes because you have nothing to lose. You do something because you love it, and when you share that you are also sharing your love, which people will pick up on.</p>
<p>Join a scenius, contribute to it, and see what other people are sharing. Take note of what people aren't sharing that you might be able to.</p>
<h2 id="you-cant-find-your-voice-if-you-dont-use-it">You Can't Find Your Voice If You Don't Use It</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Find your voice, shout it from the rooftops, and keep going it until the people that are looking for you find you.
-- Dan Harmon</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="read-obituaries">Read Obituaries</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all price, all fear of embarassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truely important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best wya I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.
-- Steve Jobs</p>

<h2 id="take-people-behind-the-scenes">Take People Behind The Scenes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of people are so used to just seeing the outcome of work. They mever see the side of the work you go through to produce the outcome.
-- Michael Jackson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't just share the end result, but the process of getting there. It give your audience a way of connecting with you, since they see you struggling along and can connect with that on a human level. It gives the audience the chance to be a part of the creative process along with the artist.</p>
<h2 id="become-a-documentarian-of-what-you-do">Become a Documentarian of What You Do</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen - really seen
-- Brene Brown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep a journal of your work. Take photos or videos of your work at various stages of completion. This isn't about making art. It's about keeping track of what's going on around you. When you're ready to share something, you'll have a surplus of material to choose from.</p>

<p>Put yourself, and your work, out there every day, and you'll start meeting some aamzing people.

<p>One day at a time. It sounds so simple. It actually is simple but it isn't easy: It requires incredible suport and fastidious structuring.
-- Russel Brand</p>

<h2 id="the-so-what-test">The "So What?" Test</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: This is not your diary. You are not letting it all hang out. You are picking and chosing every single word
-- Dani Shapiro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you share something, ask yourself "is this helpful? is this entertaining?"

<h2 id="turn-your-flow-into-stock">Turn Your Flow Into Stock</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If you work on something a little bit every day, you end up with something that is massive
-- Kenneth Goldsmith</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your flow is the steady stream of updates that remind people you exist, and stock is the larger work you produce. You want to keep your flow going while working on your stock in the background.</p>
<p>Looking back over your flow can be good for creating your stock. Social media is a good place to share ideas and get feedback from people. Over time, you might see themes emerge in your flow that can be taken and turned into stock.</p>
<h2 id="build-a-good-domain-name">Build A Good (Domain) Name</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.
-- Andy Baio</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social networks come and go so it's important to have your own personal space on the internet. Buy a domain name and set up a blog/website there. This will be your home on the interent regardless of what social networks are popular.</p>
<h1 id="4-open-up-yout-cabinet-of-curiosities">4. Open Up Yout Cabinet of Curiosities</h1>
<h2 id="dont-be-a-hoarder">Don't Be A Hoarder</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually, you'll become stale. If you give away everything you have, you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish... Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.
-- Paul Arden</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A cabinet of curiosities is a collection of objects that reflect your taste. While your work might not be good in the beginning, you can share your taste with the world. Share things that inspire you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You're only as good as your record collection
-- DJ Spooky</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="no-guilty-pleasures">No Guilty Pleasures</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't believe in guilty pleasures. If you fucking like something, like it.
-- Dave Grohl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don't feel guilty for enjoying the things other people have decided are garbage. Don't try to be hip or cool or follow trends. Being yourself is the best way to connect with people.</p>
<h2 id="credit-is-always-due">Credit Is Always Due</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Do what you do best and link to the rest
-- Jeff Jarvis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharing something without attribution not only deprives the original creator of credit for their work, it deprives the people who have seen your share of being able to follow a breadcrumb and find more of that work.</p>
<p>Always include a link someone can click. People won't bother to google a name.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To fake a photograph, all you have to do is change the caption. To fake a painting, change the attribution.
-- Errol Morris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People attribute value to art based on what they are told about it. If you want to be more effective in selling your work, you need to become a better story teller.</p>

<p>In the first act, you get your hero up a tree. In the second act you throw rocks at him. For the third act, you let him down.

<h2 id="talk-about-yourself-at-parties">Talk About Yourself At Parties</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You got to make your case
-- Kanye West</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By day I work in IT and by night I... Have empathy for your audience. Anticipate blank stares and more questions. Drop all the adjectives from your bio (you're not an aspiring photographer, you're a photographer) and never describe yourself as a rockstar, ninja or guru unless you physically are one</p>

<p>The impulse to keep to yourself what you have leadned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.
-- Annie Dillard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teaching doesn't mean instance competition. Just because you know the masters technique doesn't mean you'll be able to emulate it right away.</p>

<h2 id="shut-up-and-listen">Shut Up And Listen</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When people realise they're being listened to, they tell you things.
-- Richard Ford</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't get anywhere in creative work without paying your dues to the scene. To be a successful writer, you must first be a reader of other work you emulate. You must be a good citizen of your scene by contributing to it. You must interact with your fans at the level of being a fan. If you want to be noticed, you must first notice.</p>
<h2 id="you-want-hearts-not-eyeballs">You Want Hearts, Not Eyeballs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What you want is to follow and be followed by human beings who care about issues you care about. This thing we make together. This things is about hearts and minds, not eyeballs.
-- Jeffrey Zeldman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Focus on the quality of the people following you, not the quantity. Do this by being more of an interesting person by "being curisous, attentive and being interested". If you want to be interesting, you have to first be interested.</p>
<p>Don't try to make connections. Instead, focus on doing good work and the connections will be a natural offshoot of that.</p>
<p>"Follow me back?" is the saddest question on the internet.</p>

<p>When you find the few people who are your true peers, with the same interests and mission as you, keep them close, Sing their praises, invite them to collaborate, show them work before anyone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I ain't going to give up. Every time you think I'm one place, I'm going to show up someplace else. I came pre-hated. Take your best shot.
-- Cyndi Lauper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you take a punch:
- Relax and beathe
- Strengthen your neck (practice getting hit a lot)
- Roll with the punches
- Protect your vulnerable areas - keep any work that is too sensitive to criticism private, but don't overdo it. Compulsive avoidance of embaracement is a form of suicide.
- Keep yout balance - your work is something you do, not something you are. Don't make it too personal.</p>
<h2 id="dont-feed-the-trolls">Don't Feed The Trolls</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The trick is not caring what EVERYBODY think of you and just caring about what the RIGHT people think of you
-- Brian Michael Bendis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone took a dump in your livingroom, you wouldn't let it sit there.</p>
<p>Be wary of trolls who are making the same noises as your insecurities. Other trolls re easy to dismiss but when they hit close to home, it's easier for them to get inside your mental firewall.</p>
<p>You don't have to have comments on all your work. There's no comment section under a painting in an art gallery or at the end of a book.</p>

-- Bill Withers</p>
<p>An amateur is an artist who supports himself with outside jobs which enable him to paint. A professional is someone whose wife works to enable him to paint.

<p>I'd love to sell out completely. It's just that nobody has been willing to buy.
-- John Waters</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="keep-a-mailing-list">Keep A Mailing List</h2>
<p>Even if you don't have something to sell, collect email addresses of your fans. When you do eventually ahve something to sell, you'll have a base of followers who are so into your work that they signed up to be potentially spamed by you. Don't abuse that trust - make sure they know what they were getting into and maintain that expectation.</p>

<li>exercise</li>
