# Don't Be A Hoarder
> “The problem with hoarding is you end up living off your reserves. Eventually, you’ll become stale. If you give away everything you have, you are left with nothing. This forces you to look, to be aware, to replenish. . . . Somehow the more you give away, the more comes back to you.
> —Paul Arden

We all have our collections, whether physical or mental, of things that define our tastes. While we are working, especially in the early days when our work isn't that good, we can share our tastes while our work is improving - what books, movies or music are we into? Who do we steal our ideas from? Who are our heroes?

> You’re only as good as your record collection.
> —DJ Spooky

# No Guilty Pleasures
> I don’t believe in guilty pleasures. If you f---ing like something, like it.
> —Dave Grohl

When you share your tastes and influences, don't try to edit them to present what you think people want to see. Being an artist means being a cultural dumpster diver, finding treasure in the things other people have thrown away, finding inspiration in the things other people write off.

# Credit Is Always Due
> Do what you do best and link to the rest
> -- Jeff Jarvis

Always include attribution when you share something online. If you don't, you deprive both the original creator of exposure to a new audience, as well as that potential audience the chance to discover more of that creators work. Make it a hyperlink so people can follow it without effort. No one is going to spend the time googling someone's name.
