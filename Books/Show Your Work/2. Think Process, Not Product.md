# Take People Behind The Scenes
> A lot of people are so used to just seeing the outcome of work. They never see the side of the work you go through to produce the outcome.
> —Michael Jackson

Art and creation can mean two things: a noun and a verb. They can refer to the finished product, or to the process that created that product. Many creatives will instinctively keep the process secret, thinking the consumers of their work aren't interested in it, only in the product. In fact, the artists customers are humans and are generally interested in other human beings.

Sharing the creative process, and the vulnerability that goes with it, allows the artist to form a connection with the customer that they wouldn't had they only shared the finished product.

# Become a Documentarian Of What You Do
> In order for connection to happen, we have to allow ourselves to be seen—really seen.

Document your creative process in order to accumulate material to share. You can share things like research, references, drawings, inspiration, notes, pinboards, journals, etc. If you're creativity doesn't have a tangible output, use the artifacts of your process to create something you can share.
