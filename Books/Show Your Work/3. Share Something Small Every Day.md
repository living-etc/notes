# Send Out A Daily Dispatch
> Put yourself, and your work, out there every day, and you’ll start meeting some amazing people.
> —Bobby Solomon

> One day at a time. It sounds so simple. It actually is simple but it isn’t easy: It requires incredible support and fastidious structuring.
> —Russell Brand

When sharing your work in progress, send out a little something every day on social media. Make it a piece of your work, rather than your lunch. It doesn't have to be any good, since Sturgeon's Law states that 90% of everything is crap, which includes your work. Just make sure you don't get distracted from your actual work by social media.

# The "So What?" Test
> Make no mistake: This is not your diary. You are not letting it all hang out. You are picking and choosing every single word.
> —Dani Shapiro

Always write on the internet as if everyone who reads it has the power to fire you.

# Turn Your Flow Into Stock
> If you work on something a little bit every day, you end up with something that is massive.
> —Kenneth Goldsmith

Flow is the feed, the tweets. Stock is our main artistic output. Flow is useful as a way of generating small ideas that you might one day be able to turn into stock. For example, a lot of the ideas in this book started off as a number of tweets, which then became blog posts which then became book chapters.

# Build A Good (Domain) Name
> Carving out a space for yourself online, somewhere where you can express yourself and share your work, is still one of the best possible investments you can make with your time.
> —Andy Baio

Having a little corner of the internet to call your own is invaluable. As social media sites come and go, your personal website will remain. It may be rebuilt multiple times over the course of years, but as long as the domain still points to the same place, people will always find you.

> Don’t think of your website as a self-promotion machine, think of it as a self-invention machine. Online, you can become the person you really want to be.
