# Work Doesn't Speak For Itself
> To fake a photograph, all you have to do is change the caption. To fake a painting, change the attribution.

Artists like to say "my work speaks for itself", but in reality it doesn't. If it did, then an authentic painting wouldn't be any more valuable than a perfect forgery. People want to connect, and the story behind the painting is what makes the authentic one valuable. Tell the story of your work in your tweets, blog posts, newsletter, etc.
