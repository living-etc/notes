# Who Should Read It?
Anyone in a management role is encouraged to read this, but it's even more important for those currently in their first role to learn how to shift the focus of their work away from the comfortable realm of their old role and onto the uncomfortable but very valuable realm of their new one.

# How the Book Changed Me
After finishing the first chapter on a Sunday night, I'm already making notes for how I'm going to change my entire approach to work the next day. It made me realise I'd been going about it all wrong, and a lot of things I was supposed to be doing were getting dropped.

I initially thought that coaching individuals was just one of many responsibilities of a manager, but after reading that first chapter I learned it is actually a management style that is supposed to be threaded through everything I do.

# Why did I read this?
I start it because I'd recently been promoted into a management role with expectations that I would be coaching and mentoring younger engineers. I didn't comfortably know how to do this, so I entered "coaching" into Amazon and this was the first result.
