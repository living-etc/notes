- Making the change to managing as a coach
- Taking a look at the tools of coaching

# Summary
Being an effective manager in the modern workforce means being a coach over a doer, which means working according to the principle of _and_ instead of _or_. This means you consider your job to be a balance of managing people _and_ tasks (a coach), rather than people _or_ tasks (a doer, who usually prioritises the tasks over the people).

Being a coach is to step away from the work that is your background, and instead focus your efforts on developing the people who will do the work in your place. It means empowering your employees to be responsible for their own problems, and equipping them with the tools to solve them.

# Getting The Lowdown On Business Coaching
Coaching, in a business context, has the following parts to its definition:
> - being an approach to management, how one carries out the role of being a manager.
> - a set of skills for managing employee performance to deliver results.

- managing as a coach means developing and challenging your employees skills so they learn and grow, allowing you to get the best out of them.
- coaching tools include:
	- setting goals and performance plans
	- giving performance feedback
	- conducting periodic performance reviews
	- guiding development through mentoring and tutoring
	- tutoring with questions
	- taking employees under your wing
	- motivating employee performance
	- delegating to empower and increase productivity
	- training for skill development
	- stimulating and supporting career development
	- intervening to build improvement in performance

- your relationship will vary from one employee to the next, someone needing direction and firmness while others need a lighter touch, and the coaching tools are tailored to the individuals skill level and needs.
- the key to successful coaching is spending quality time, rather than quantity time, with each employee so they return to their job to perform better.

# Fine, but do I really need to be a coach?
Coaching helps you to:
- do more with fewer resources
- get employees to adapt to change
- find ways to increase efficiency and productivity
- create an environment to retain employees
- meet greater customer expectations
- deliver results

- It's about helping employees work smarter not harder
- modern management is about moving from being a task-manager to being a coach who empowers employees
- coaching is about getting your employees to step up and take responsibility instead of waiting to be told what to do

# Managing as a Coach versus as a Doer
- managing as a coach means managing the work by managing the people. By developing the people doing the work, you enable them to do greater quantities of higher quality work in less time. ^6b0496
- managing as a doer focuses more on the technical part of their role, functioning as a senior individual contributor.
- the key difference between these two roles is _and_ vs _or_ - the coach approaches the job as a balance between managing people and managing tasks. Doers, on the other hand, consider themselves either to have task issues or people issues to deal with, seeing the two as unconnected and generally preferring to focus on getting things done.

# I'm a Doer, You're a Doer - So Many Mangers Are Doers
- Most managers end up being doers for the following reasons:
	- people often get started in management by being good doers and getting promoted from the ranks of the workers.
	- because of this, many of the role models of new manager are doers.
	- many managers tend to focus their continued learning on their technical field, often not seeing management as a discipline in its own right.
- If you find yourself following the doer style of management
	- you're not a bad person, you just need to learn the skills of the coaching style
	- you're part of a very big club
	- coaches are doers too, just sharing their focus with coaching their employees.
	- technical competence is important for coaching effectively.
