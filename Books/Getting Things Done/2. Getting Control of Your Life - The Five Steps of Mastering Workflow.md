In order to achieve this relaxed control over the commitments in our lives, we must:
1. capture what has our attention
2. clarify what each item means and what to do about it
3. organize the results
4. reflect on them
5. engage with them

It is generally better to split these five steps out and do them at different times of the day, rather than try to do them all at once, so you can focus your mind properly.

- an "**incomplete**" is defined as anything in our world that is not where or how it should be
- an item becomes an incomplete as soon as we attach a "should", "need to" or "ought to" to it, because this shows decisions still need to be made on it.
- all incompletes needs to be captured in containers somewhere which are emptied regularly as we make decisions on what to do with them
