# Day 3: 5 Productivity Tip for Part-Time YouTubers
## 1. Batching
> Pick a day. Maybe once a week or fortnight. Maybe if you’re super pro, one a month. Sit down, and film yourself doing 2, 3, maybe 5 videos at a time. It’s honestly game-changing. You always have extras in the bank and you don’t need to keep setting things up again and again every time you want to get 30 minutes of filming done. Trust me.

## 2. Stealing ideas like an artist
> It’s a total myth that ideas are original. They really aren’t. Some of the biggest artists themselves refer to their work as ‘[stealing](https://geni.us/IAWAbOR?utm_campaign=Ali%27s%20Part-Time%20YouTuber%20Crash-Course&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)’. Of course, there are lines one can cross, but if you’re a beginner, you’re really very safe. Chances are, you won’t have the equipment, time or resources to create videos _exactly_ like the ones you see. So you’re fine. Honestly, go for anything.

## 3. Parallel Processing
> Let’s say you see a video that resonates with you - write this title and idea somewhere. A thumbnail you can recreate - screenshot it. You read a sentence in a book making a good argument on a subject you’re interested in - add it to your resources.
>
> In this way you make it so you **never need to start from a blank page**. You’ll always have multiple little half-formed or almost-fully-scripted videos waiting for you at all times. If you batch a time to add finishing touches - your content will seriously never stop flowing.

This is the second brain principle of starting with abundance by having multiple slow-burn projects on the go at once. It's dependent on my developing another second brain principle, that of building a collection habit.

## 4. Systematic Structuring
Some ideas for video structure:
- Listicle
- Essay
> This is what we used to do in English Literature. And there’s a reason they required it - it makes sense and sounds good. You have an intro that explains the issue. You have a body divided into sections that ideally each make a single point. You weigh options. You compare pros and cons. You summarise in the end. It’s essentially an oral essay. [Here’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=109s&utm_campaign=Ali%27s%20Part-Time%20YouTuber%20Crash-Course&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=waR3xBDHMqw) my example of this.

- Story Structures
> This is the Gold Standard. This is what I wish I could be doing with every video and what I’m aiming for. Humans have evolved around stories, we love them. So if you can turn what you say into a story that follows a hero’s journey, everything will become endlessly more attractive to the viewer. Make what you say **personal** and show how it has **transformed** you, and more people will be compelled to listen. A better example of what the hero’s journey actually means is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=53s&utm_campaign=Ali%27s%20Part-Time%20YouTuber%20Crash-Course&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter&v=Hhk4N9A0oCA).

## 5. Efficient Editing
> Editing takes possibly the largest chunk of time. You’ll quickly realise how many ‘umms’ and ‘ahhhs’ you’re injecting after every. other. word.

# Day 4: Creating Valuable Educational Content is a Skill
## The Curse of Knowledge
Once you become an expert in a topic, you can forget what it's like to be a beginner.

## Guide not Guru
> I never paint myself as someone who’s figured it all out and is spreading his wisdom (the Guru). I’m just some guy with a camera who’s trying something out to see if it works and sharing his journey with others (Guide). If you’re the latter, it’s hard to go wrong.

> Talk about what you’re figuring out, and you’ll be fine.

# Day 5: What It Takes to Success on YouTube
## 1. Consistency
Pick a schedule and stick to it

## 2. Faith and Patience
> Be ready for zero views, engagement, subscribers. Be ready for crickets for a long time. Set your expectations and be patient. It’s the only way to succeed.

## 3. Hard Work
> Yep, it’s really no different to everything else. It takes putting in the time, even when you don’t feel like it, look like it or sound like it.

## 4. Unfair Advantages
> These are really worth spending a bit of time thinking about. What will make you stand out? What things are you fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have that you can focus on?

> How can you stack the deck in your favour? It might be having the money to buy the best gear out there and have sick production value from day one, or it might be your poor gut health prompting you to try different diets you can talk about.

## 5. Luck
> In the end of the day, growth and all numerical measures of success depend a great deal on luck. And while you can’t really do much to increase your luck, you can definitely make sure that you stack the deck in your favour. So that when luck does come your way, you’re ready to seize the opportunity.

> So should traffic increase to your channel, people will be much more likely to subscribe if you already have useful content.

> Being intentional with what you consume on YouTube will increase the chances of you seeing the type of inspirational content you need. Posting regularly a couple of times a week will increase the chances that one of your videos will pop off. You can, to some extent, manufacture luck.
