# Story construction
## What constitutes a story?
Either
- Transformation (I used to be one thing and now I'm something else)
- Realization (I used to think one thing and now I think something else)

It's always about change. It's about how I became a different human being over a series of events. There's a five second moment when things change.

Creating a frame for your story
- Find your moment of transformation
- Find the opposite of your moment of transformation
	- Going from an ordinary kitchen spoon to a magical spoon
- Develop your thesis statement

Starting your story effectively
- Start as close to the end as possible
	- Start with the moment Jamie put his hand out of the leaves.
- Begin with forward movement
	- Jamie thrust his hand our of the leaves and declared he found the spoon
- Avoid exposition
- Create a sense of wonder
	- You must force people to be interested in you by making them wonder what the next thing is going to happen

The Cinema of Storytelling
- Tell your story in scenes

# Three ways to infuse storytelling into your instructional content
- First person story (the best)
	- The best because you talk about yourself so you can be vulnerable
- Second person story telling
	- The audience becomes the protagonist
- Third persons storytelling
	- Create a world around your topic
	- Lends itself to character creation
	- Repetition and call backs work well

```ad-note
title: Advice for storytelling on YouTube
Tell stories adjacent to your channel theme(s).

For example, for a nutirition channel, don't talk about the different ways people each privately and publically, instead talk about some other way epople behave differently in private and public, then bring it back to the actual topic.
```


# Q&A
## What's the difference between vulnerability and oversharing?
When the audience has become a therapist, then it's over sharing. Vulnerability is when you have processed the story enough that you can tell it without relying on the audience for emotional support.

You tell stories about your scars, not your wounds.

Oversharing is done for the benefit of the person speaking, while vulnerability is done for the benefit of the people in the room.

## What's your thought process for telling a story for the first time.
Start with **location** and **action**. When I tell you I'm at a place it triggers the imagination. Then I'm going to tell them I'm doing something. They don't want to know what the weather is like or how tall the trees are unless they are directly relevant to the story.

The first minute of your story is the most important minute of your story.
