# Insights
- Production value is important to getting people to watch your videos, but not when you're a beginner. Only intermediate and advanced YouTubers need to put a lot of effort into production quality.
- Good production value keeps your audience engaged. Without it, your video is at best boring, and at worst unpleasant to watch.
- There are four aspects to good production value: **audio**, **video**, **lighting** and **editing**.
- To get good **audio**:
	- it's important to have an external microphone, using the microphone built into your phone only if you're on the very tight budget.
	- it's important to get it as close to your mouth as possible. A $10 lavalier mic attached to your shirt will give better audio than a $1000 microphone an arms length from your mouth.
- To get good **video**:
	- you want to be looking at the **focal length** and **aperture** of your lens. You want a good zoomed in view of yourself while including a good shot of the background to make it look interesting.
	- Something to bear in mind is a blurred background looks more aesthetically pleasing, and you can get different blurred effects by tuning these two values.
- To get good **lighting**:
	- you only _need_ one great big soft light illuminating your face. Other lights (fill light and back light) can improve the shot, but aren't as important as the key light.
- Editing and video production will be covered in greater detail in a later video, but in the meantime five tips for better editing are:
	- **Tighter a-roll cuts**. Minimize the pauses. This is why you get jump cuts in YouTube videos.
	- **Titles, lower thirds, and transitions**. Titles are text overlayed on the screen, lower thirds appear at the bottom like on a news broadcast, and a transition can make the move from one scene to another more pleasing.
	- **Background music**. Think about the vibe you want for your channel, and choose a backing track accordingly. Make sure it's not too noticeable that it distracts from the content, for example -30db.
	- **Subtle sound effects**. For example, when titles appear. Keep them subtle though, so again they are not drawing the viewers attention away from the content.
	- **10 Second Rule - Pattern Interrupts**. Making something happen on the screen at least as frequently as every 10 seconds. It starts to get boring when things aren't happening on screen for long periods of time.

# Notes
## How important is production value?  
Generally, the higher the production value, the better, but it's not that simple so we'll break it down in this session.

## What does "good production value" mean?  
- Viewer doesn't think about the looks/sound
- It's pleasant to watch 
- great visual storytelling

Ultimately production value is important if it matters to your audience. Not all channels need to worry about production value. It only matters to your audience if it's a part of your vibe.

## Our model
Whether or not your focused on production quality will be determined by where you're at in your YouTube journey

If you're at levels 1 and 2, it doesn't matter. Your focus should be showing up each week and building the habit of creating videos.

As we established in the last session, it takes an average of 150 videos to reach 1000 subscribers, and in that time no one is going to be watching your videos so production quality doesn't matter.

## Audio  
![[PTYA 1.2 - Audio.png]]

![[PTYA 1.2 - Level 1 - External Microphone.png]]

Level 0 is about recording with the microphone attached to your camera/phone.

![[PTYA 1.2 - Level 1 - External Microphone 2.png]]

![[PTYA 1.2 - Level 2 - External Microphone + Stand.png]]

Most people can\t tell the different between $50 and $50,000 microphones provided it's close to your mouth because ultimately that's what make good audio quality. Even small changes in the distance can have significant consequences to the quality of the audio.

![[PTYA 1.2 - Level 3 - External XLR Microphone.png]]

![[PTYA 1.2 - Level 3 - External Recorder.png]]

You can also use a USB microphone like a Blue Yeti that you have in the shot with you. On the other hand, part of production value can include appearing to not use a microphone, so it's about personally preference.

![[PTYA 1.2 - Lav vs Boom Mic.png]]

Lavalier mics are a good option because they are cheap and close to your mouth. A $10 lavalier mic attached to your collar will be better than a $600 microphone a meter your mouth.

## Video

![[PTYA 1.2 - Lens Recommendations.png]]

You want your head to be just about brushing the top of the frame. A lot of people shoot at 50mm focal length because it looks nice. The higher the focal length number, the more zoomed in it'll be.

The lower number will show you more of the background. Going too low to something like 16mm gives you distortion on the edge of the frame so isn't advises. The more zoomed in you can get, the higher your production value will look and (and the more blurry your background will look).

If you're using a crop frame camera, you need to multiply all numbers by 1.5, so a 16mm lens on a crop sensor camera is equivalent to a 24mm lens on a full frame camera.

The lower the f number on the lens, the more blurred your background will be.

## Lighting  
![[PTYA 1.2 - Standard Three-Point Lighting.png]]

Second key light should actually be called a "fill light".

Only really need to worry about the first key light. You only really need one enormous light illuminating you.

![[PTYA 1.2 - The Ultimate Lighting Setup.png]]

Another way to get a soft light source is to bounce lights off a wall. Sitting in the corner of the room while shooting into the bulk of it with lights reflected off the corner walls is one way to get an aesthetic looking blurred background.

# Q&A
**What do you mean by production value? Just fancy camera broll shots or something bigger than that?**
Broadly, production value is anything that makes you think "oh, this looks good". Is it visually engaging? Does it sound nice?

**What was your big “why” Ali, to keep you consistent during your early days? What kept you motivated when it got challenging?**
1. I had a goal that was entirely within my control - make one or two videos per week for two years, then after that time I'll see what happens. I didn't focus on anything that was outside of my control.
2. Keep it fun. Have friends in the room studying while doing my editing. Order takeaway to treat myself while editing.

**Question: What’s the difference between mic going into an XLR port (like a zoom recorder) vs mic going into the camera TRS port?**
Basically nothing. XLR mics are higher quality than TRS ones. Most people won't notice the difference so it doesn't really matter.

**Which lense and cam are you using for streaming**
A7Siii + Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 lens

**What does Ali think about recording with AirPods (I have airports pro) in a quiet room?**
Airpods are bad. The audio quality isn't very good, but its better than nothing.

**How do you film directly on top of the book while also writing? Is the camera above your head? Or like below your chin?**
The camera is above my head. I have a c-stand holding the camera downwards over my head. It's a pain, but worth the effort to add the production value.

**What about level 1 with a smart phone? for outside vlogging? Can a DEADCAT be attached or something equivalent?**
Yes, you can get a Rode video micro, which comes with a deadcat.

**If we’re filming with our phone, I’m assuming we should not use the selfie camera? I won’t be able to see myself if I use the camera on the other side (opposite side of screen)?**
Two ways to film with your phone.

1. You can use the selfie camera so you can see yourself. You don't want to be looking at yourself while filming, rather you want to be looking into the lens.
2. Use the camera on the back. It's higher quality, so worth the faff to set up.

**How do you edit the audio on post-production?**
Nothing.

**Do you use a teleprompter? if so, what’s you're experience with it? Does it really help?**
I don't. Most of what I do is spoken from the heart. If you're going to write your scripts word for word it can help. You need to get the practice though. When you start using one, you're usually unnaturally fixated on the screen.

**If you're recording screencasts while at the computer, where do you put the camera? On the monitor is a bit high but below it or off to the side is even more noticable**
I'd just put the camera over to the side of me, and look at the screen, so people will see there's something on the screen and I can turn to the camera when I need to address the audience.

It deosn't really matter where the camera goes, as long as it is aesthetically pleasing.

**Do you recommend trying to film, then cropping if it doesn’t go right? Or just trying to get the right frame from the beginning?**
Definitely try to get the right frame from the beginning. Cropping will cost you quality. If getting the perfect frame is stopping you filming though, then just record the imperfect one and crop it.

**How do you avoid glare on your eyeglasses?**
i don't think about it that much.

**Is there a setup that works best for a 1 man show? (No camera help)**
Everything we've talked about here works for a one person show.

**Previously, I had a Youtube channel but I stopped posting videos almost half a year ago for some reason. This channel has about 40 videos, more than 150 subscribers, each video has very few views, from 20 to 100 views. Currently, I want to make videos on a different topic. Should I post upcoming videos to that channel or create a new channel and post videos to the new channel?**
Create a new channel.

**Any suggestions on how to sync the background music with the video? If the video duration is longer than the music itself, do you insert multiple songs or the same music but multiple times? How do you make sure the music ends properly with the video clip?**
I have a video about this in my skillshare class. The easiest way is to just copy and paste the same track and cut it at the end.

**When recording your screen (software review for example), which one is best? Recording yourself with chroma key or just record yourself with the background and put yourself on a circle/rectangle?**
Most people use a circle/rectangle. It's easier and still looks pro.

**Is it better to zoom all the way out, and keep your camera closer? Or keep your camera further away and just zoom in? Just for context, I’m using a 18-55mm basic Canon lens that came with my camera**
If you can, I'd zoom all the way in and have the camera further back, but that's a very broad brushstroke rule.

**Jim - Do you have any advice for using a gimbal, especially if you are going to be moving around a bit?**
I don't like gimbals. They take a while to learn to use. If you need to use one, you can find tutorials on YouTube.

**How did you get the clarity of consistency? How did you get the idea and decide that’s what you needed to do to be successful? I got the idea that consistency was necessary for success from you. How did you arrive at the decision that you just needed to be consistent and stick with it for long enough to matter?**
This is just how you succeed in life. I've been drinking the koolade of self-improvement for the last ten years and it was just obvious to me when I started YouTube.

It's just standard advice when starting something. To learn photography, take lots of photos. To become a writer, write a lot.

**I have a boom mic but my room is very echoey. Any suggestion to help with echo?**
Basically when you need is a rug and as much soft furnishings as possible. If it's impossible to get these, then you can get sound blankets that you put up when you're recording and take them down when you're done.

**How can I avoid making my camera look wonky? Is it just a matter of making camera at eye level, or are there other things to watch out for so frame doesn’t look wonky?**
Look at the lines in the background. The things that need to be vertical or horizontal should be where they need to be. 

**Any suggestions on how to get the lighting to look good beyond a big key light? When I film at night with my key light it looks dark or yellowish on my face and not as good as with natural lighting, but the light is different in each cut**
You need to set your white balance and ISO manually. If your light is not yellow, and it's looking yellow on your face, then you need to adjust the white balance on your camera.

**Do you use the same camera for filming - and for zoom calls? Or a webcam for Zoom?**
I use a webcam for zoom, unless I'm really trying to impress someone.

**I make videos in English. I heard that adding English subtitles to the video helps youtube algorithm since youtube would have my subtitles to help them understand more what my video is about. Would you agree with this**
Any time you optimise for making things better for the audience, tha algorithm will reward you.

**When you were filming with an iPhone, did you ever run into 'variable frame rate' issues where the audio and video would get out of sync? How did you deal with that?**
It'a about making sure your video timeline is legit, and there is software you can use to correct drifted audio. I use pulareyes when I need to correct audio drift.

**How to reduce ambient noise if you don’t have a massively quite room or if you have a child.**
Have the microphone as close to your face as possible. A podcasting specific microphone that's on the desk and very close to my mouth will cut out a lot of background noise.
