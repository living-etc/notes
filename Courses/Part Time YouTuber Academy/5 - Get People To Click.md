- Rules for making a good title:
	1. **Sell the result rather than the process**
		1. How I type really fast
		2. How I remember everything I read
	2. **Intrigue vs agreement**
		1. you want to build intrigue rather than get agreement. Get the viewer wanting to know the answer to a question you've put in their head rather than have them say "yes, I agree with that" before moving on.
	3. **Don't describe**
		1. If you're going to provide a summary of a book, don't title it "book summary".
	4. **Optimize for humans, not machines**
		1. 8 Habits that made me a millionaire - didn't include anything like "pomodoro" that productivity bros will be interested in, instead focused on creating a title that generated intrigue
	5. **Consider A/B testing your titles**
- Rules for making good thumbnails:
	1. **Make it pop**
		1. Most videos are watched on mobile and the thumbnails are tiny so they need to be attention grabbing.
		2. Take a proper photo, not a still from the video
			1. Make it 16:9
			2. Increase the contrast to make it pop more
			3. Increase the shadows
	2. **Think vibe**
		1. Mr Beast is loud and in your face, childlike
		2. Matt D'Avella is more muted, neutral, minimal, gender neutral
		3. "Your vibe attracts your tribe"
			1. The more audacious thumbnails attract a younger audience
	3. **Emotion is good, if it fits the vibe**
	4. **They're not an afterthought**
	5. **(For Pros) Use Tubebuddy**
		1. Removing text from thumbnails made them do better
		2. Making them pop made them perform better
- When creating a thumbnail, the science will tell us to have a human face with a shocked expression on the thumbnail, but you need to consider the artistic side of the thumbnail as well.
- Once you've earned the click with the title and thumbnail, you then need to keep them watching with a good hook, with these six possible examples:
	- **Ask a question**
	- **Share a fact**
	- **Offer a transformation "from this to that"**
	- **Provide a tip**
	- **Show enticing b-roll**
	- **Preview a clip from later in the video**

# Notes
## Intro
Coming up with a title and thumbnail isn't something beginners should be thinking about. This is for when you are comfortably producing one video per week and are ready to move onto producing one good video per week.

## How do you get clicks?
![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.27.06.png]]

This is easier said than done because _everyone_ on YouTube is trying to get people to click on their video.

The packaging of a video matter just as much, maybe more so, than the content. There will be 20x more people who will see your thumbnail than your video. You can have the best content in the world, but it won't matter if no one clicks on the video because no one will see it.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.28.50.png]]
Title and thumbnail are the two leavers we have to play with to earn the click.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.30.41.png]]
A beginner thinks "i want to make a video about this thing" and they made the video. While the video is uploading, they think about the thumbnail. A pro doesn't make a video unless they have a title and thumbnail already created.

A video concept isn't worth the paper its printed on. A video concept and a title is very much worth the paper.

Spend time brainstorming titles. For a video concept, come up with 10, 20 or 30 titles. The best title for your video will rarely be the first one you think of.

## Titles
How do we create an intriguing title.

## Browse vs search
Whenever you make a video, you want to think whether you are targeting browse or search? Targeting browse is creating a video that someone will see on their homepage, while targeting search is creating a specific video that someone is searching for.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.42.04.png]]

Example: creating a video about cooking biryani.

Search ideas:
- Cooking biryani in 15 minutes
- Cooking biryani Pakistani style

Browse ideas:
- The best biryani you'll every make
- Top secret biryani 

## A good title
![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.46.49.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.48.06.png]]
"Understanding the spotlight effect" isn't an effective title because it's talking about the process. "How to beat impostor syndrome" is a good title because it talk about the result.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.50.18.png]]
"How writing online made me a millionaire" wasn't the original title of this video. It was "how writing online changed my life" and it was the worst performing video of the last 10 when it was published. Changing the title caused it to become one of the best performing videos on the channel.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 20.54.58.png]]
Don't describe what your video is about unless you're targeting search.

```ad-note
title: Watch YouTube for your job

You can get a good feel for what makes good content by watching more videos on the platform. Think about watching youtube as a productive use of your time. Being a YouTuber who doesn't watch a lot of YouTube videos would be like a film director who didn't watch films, or an author who didn't read other peoples work.

You get a lot of inspiration from other people on the platform you're trying to create for. As as YouTuber, you should watch YouTube intentionally and think about why is this title working.
```

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.03.30.png]]
A mistake beginners mistake is optimizing for the algorithm. You don't need to teach YouTube what your video is about using keywords because YouTube already knows what it's about because they have a very sophisticated system for figuring that out. Optimize your title for people, rather than machines.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.05.32.png]]
The apple products video is a video about how Ali likes apple products, but that's not very intriguing so it was rewritten to be more of a title a person would want to click on.

## A/B testing
![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.06.57.png]]
Use a tool like Tubebuddy to A/B test your titles. Generally, you need to have a large number of views for this to make sense. It's not worth doing if you have less than 10,000 subscribers. You'll need roughly 1000 clicks for this to work.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.09.29.png]]
You want to run your title and thumbnail through thumbsup.tv to make sure it's going to appear properly on all parts of YouTube. Titles longer than 53 characters are going to get cut off on some parts of the site.

## Clickable thumbnails

## Emotion and vibe
People will tell you that showing a very shocked expression on your thumbnail with your eyes wide open is statistically more likely to perform well on the paltform.

That's because YouTube's age demographic skews younger, and it's kids who are more taken in by those types of thumbnails. The demographic on this course is unusual for YouTube.

If you're creating a channel that isn't that vibe, then you don't need to create those loud thumbnails. Create the thumbnails that are apprioriate for the vibe you're of your channel.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.45.52.png]]
Using tubebuddy reveals things like text on thumbnails makes them not perform well.

## Art and science
The science tells us we need to have a face in the thumbnail and show the whites of their eyes while making a shacked expression, but you need to balance that with the artistic direction of your thumbnails, and the vibe you're creating for your channel.

## Keep them watching
![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.49.29.png]]

Earning the click is about title, thumbnail and concept, and now we keep people watching with the hook.

Examples:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjoxkxM_I5g

![[Screenshot 2022-01-18 at 21.55.59.png]]

The more shebang you can put into the first 30 second, the more likely people are to stick around. You want to front load your fancy editing to make people think it's an engaging video so they will keep watching.

# Q&A
-   **Once a YouTuber is generating passive income, should they register themselves under a business? Are there any practical advantages to doing so (e.g. tax exemptions on business related purchases)**
	-   Generally yes. It depends on the country you're in. If you're in the UK, you need to do it if you're making more than £1000 per year.
-   **What are the pros & cons of unlisting/deleting versus keeping first a couple videos later in the YouTube journey? Considering PTYA homework assignments are my first videos, I am concerned to later find them not meeting my quality bars or deviating too far from my eventual niche (or both).**
	-   Generally no one really cares about your old videos, but if your channel doesn't have many videos and these videos are making your channel look bad, then go ahead and unlist them.
-   **I understand that to never run out of ideas we need to ensure we are applying those 7 systems and have coal mines. I am currently focusing on documenting as a way to develop my content while finding the fine line between what I can teach and what my audience wants/needs. I am not running out of ideas per say (for now :)) … so is it safe to say that the idea generation mechanism is only needed at a later stage in this YouTube journey?**
	-   Yes. If you're not running out of ideas, don't worry about the idea generation machine.
-   **Thoughts on updating thumbnails and titles for older videos? Are we better off holding off publishing if we don’t have a good thumbnail ready?**
	-   It depends. If you;re a small youtuber, no one cares. Just publish the video. If you're a big youtuber, waiting an extra 24 hours for a better thumbnail is worth it.
	-   If the analytics tell you the video is good but you're not getting the clicks, then do it.
-   **Just wanted to ask, have you ever reached a click-through-rate of 10%+? I usually get 3%, but recently got 6%, but would love to see 10%+ looks like**
	-   The only time I've ever got a 10%+ clickthrough rate has been on community content, that is content for people who care about me personally.
-   **For shorts, should we be going for browse titles, since most ppl discover shorts through the short shelf?**
	-   Yes
-   **Would you recommend a separate YT channel for podcasts vs regular videos, if they are about the same niche?**
	-   Generally yes. usually people subscribe to a youtube channel because they like you, while most people subscribe to a podcast because they like the podcast.
-   **Is it worth creating thumbnails for shorts, since most ppl discover them on the short shelf, but it’ll look not great on your Video page?**
	-   Generally yes, because a bunch of channels I know who do shorts get a lot of views from browse.
-   **Do you think thumbnails that don’t show a face (like many tech channels like MKBHD) would be good for a channel focused on personal finance and investing. Something like a photo of a phone showing earnings (no text on the thumbnail)**
	-   Most finance channels have the creators face on the thumbnail.
-   **What is Ali’s average retention percentage?**
	-   In the low 30s.
-   **How to manage content schedule if some of my videos require more production time or involve travel (that can take a total of up to 2 weeks of constant work to produce, along with my day job)? Especially if I want to post good quality videos 3 times a month which are probably hard to batch film.**
	-   You just need to be organized. Gantt charts are really helpful for this. Most youtubers I know who had involved videos like this used a gantt chart.
-   **I'm doing well with skits on TikTok & IG Reels. This is part of my unfair advantage. But, they don't perform as well on Shorts and I'm not sure if Long Form Skits will land for my YT audience (young professional personal growth)? Any thoughts...**
	-   A lot of skits do really well on shorts. You need to run more experiments. You've run 5 and you need to run at least 50.
-   **Can you outsource someone to research titles and thumbnails? Is this the natural next step after outpouring editing?**
	-   You can. The thing is, invariably it's the people who spend the most time on youtube who have a feel for what makes a good title and thumbnail.
	-   Ultimately, it's quite hard to outsource that aspect of being a youtuber.
-   **Can you grow organically on YouTube from 0 subs without sharing on other social platforms?**
	-   Yes. Most people who grow on youtube don't share on other platforms. Sharing on other platforms isn't how you grow on youtube. You grow on youtube by making good videos.
-   **What's your process for actually _choosing_ your final title? After you brainstorm 10+ titles, do you analyse each of them with coschedule's Headline Analyzer? Do you do keyword searches? Do you just pick "oh, this one's my favourite"?**
	-   Generally, we go with this one's my favourite.
-   **Should we care about tags?**
	-   No. Tags are completely irrelevant.
-   **Is it important to introduce yourself in every video and say what your channel is about in the first 30 seconds or is that counterproductive to hooking people in? Would you have suggestions on where to share that info if it’s not ideal in the first 30 seconds?**
	-   People have different opinions on this. Half the people I know say yes, the other half say no.
	-   The people who say yes are erring towards the no anyway.
	-   It's useful if you're leaning on some credentials.
	-   Just get into the content as quick as possible.
-   **Should we optimise our titles for our niche when we are still small?**
	-   It depends. If you're publishing one video per week and making them good, then yes. If you're still struggling to publish one video per week then no, just focus on the videos.
-   **What are the optimal days/times to publish our YouTube videos?**
	-   It tells you in the analytics tab, nut it really doesn't matter when you publish.
-   **For developing your vibe should you take a look at the thumbnails of other people in your niche?**
	-   Yes, absolutely. When you want to develop an aesthetic for anything, you want to take inspiration from elsewhere.
-   **How to not over-research with the videos? Is there a way to know that you have covered enough information and stop feeling like you didn’t cover every aspect of the topic?**
	-   Deadlines. If you give yourself a certain amount of time to do a video, you'll get it done. If you spend three months to make a video, you'll spend three months doing research and the last day making the video.
-   **If you could go back to your younger self when starting you YT journey, and you could only implement one change, what would it be?**
	- Most youtubers will say I wish I spent more time on titles and thumbnails, but I'm happy with the stage of growth the channel is at.
	- I wish I documented more of the process, keeping a journal.

## Questions in Chat
-   **Is it the best homework or is it by level like a best beginner, best intermediate, best advanced person?**
	-   best as in most impressive, we don’t focus on production value or anything advanced like that!
-   **Can you let us know which homework videos won so we can watch them?** 
	-   Winners of best homework will be posted  in community wins 
-   **Thoughts on updating thumbnails and titles for older videos? Are we better off holding off publishing if we don’t have a good thumbnail ready?**
	-   They'll never find you without the algorithm pushing those titles and thumbnails though
-   **What happens if you don't have a team to help you test titles and thumbnails?**
	-   Can be done on your own! But asking the community/friends/family/accountability buddy/as many people as you can which they would click on the most
-   **Does it count as a view when I just watch 1 sec?**
	-   No. There’s an algorithm for what counts as a view - used to be at least 30seconds, now it depends on the video and is more complex than a straightforward time for each video. Shorts changed that up (less than 30 seconds sounds as a view on shorts). And it depends on the type of video and quality of view eg. if you just open your video in many tabs and watch all of them, then YT knows = low quality view. Won’t help the algorithm much, and might not be counted as a view. No specific time, but defo not click = view
-   **What’s more important, watch time duration or % watched. It seems like 40% is good for % watched but what about a good benchmark for duration?**
	-   we should aim for at least 30 seconds on each video (this part should be the most engaging) and try to keep the audience watching as long as possible.
-   **Just wanted to ask, have you ever reached a click-through-rate of 10%+? I usually get 3%, but recently got 6%, but would love to see 10%+ looks like.** 
	-   yes - usually vlogs/announcements get very high CTR (20-30% in day 1 for me) but then drops. CTR depends massively on channel size, video type, and what time after posting we’re considering. That’s highest though! Usually 10-20% for good video day 1.
-   **Is A/B testing only available for the paid version of TubeBuddy?**
	-   you can always A/B test yourself, just changed and look up your CTR and analytics, I usually do it that way
-   **I recently received 50,000 impressions, but only like 1.2k views. Does that mean, the algorithm did push it out to more people, but people just didn’t click it because of the title/thumbnail?**
	-   pretty much, yes
-   **How many characters before title gets cut off?**
	-   53
-   **Would you recommend a separate YT channel for podcasts vs regular videos, if they are about the same niche?**
	-   Yes
-   **What’s the free alternative to lightroom?**
	-   Lightroom is free on mobile. But also just native iPhone photo app is great.
