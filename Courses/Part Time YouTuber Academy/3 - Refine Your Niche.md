# Insights
- Having a niche is important for the growth of your channel since it makes it easy for YouTube to recommend your videos to other people.
- There are two way to think about your niche: as an **architect**, who has a complete plan from the beginning; or as an **archaeologist** who explores different sites to see if there is anything interesting there.
- Most people will benefit from being an archaeologist, especially beginners.
- Finding your niche can be broken down into three stages:
	- **Who am I and what do I want?**. Answer this by answering the following questions, focusing on quantity:
		- What am I good at? What would others say I'm good at that I might not necessarily say about myself?
		- What do I enjoy
		- what do I wish I has known three years ago, five years ago or ten years ago that I could help people with now?
		- How could I combine some of the points about to make a niche?
		- What does my dream YouTube channel look like?
		- What gets me excited about growing my channel?
		- What benefits does my channel have for someone else? Does it solve a problem for them? Does it entertain them? What future does that person want?
	- **Who is my audience and what do they want?**
		- What's their story? What's their personality like? What do they value? How do they spend their time?
		- Lots of [[3 - Refine Your Niche#What does my audience look like|example questions in the notes for this section]].
	- **What value am I giving to my audience?**
		- There are two types of value proposition: **explicit**, where you say it to your audience, usually at the start of your video; and **implicit**, which is what you hope your audience is thinking about you.
- It's important to bear in mind that focusing on your niche is about focusing on the growth of your channel, which means not focusing on having fun creating videos about content you are passionate about. There's an element of growth that's based on your viewers connecting with you, which is more likely to happen if they think you are having fun, and it comes across quite obviously in your videos if you're not. Find a balance between focusing on growth, and having fun making videos.

# Notes
## What's the point of YouTube & Your Elevator pitch
![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 20.39.35.png]]

We need to understand this when thinking about our niche.

If you were in an elevator and someone asked you what your channel is about, what would you say?

This is a very useful thing to do in order to gain clarity on what you're trying to do. when we think about whether or not we should make a particular video, we can thinl about whether or not it fits our niche.

## Architect vs Archaeologist
Two approaches to figuring out your niche
- **Architect** - plan everything out up front before starting, like building a house.
- **Archaeologist** - spots an area where they think "maybe there's something interesting here". Sometimes the site doesn't have anything interesting and they move on, and sometimes the site has treasure.

The archaeologist is the most beginner friendly approach. Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks.

## Finding Your Niche
The three levels of finding your niche
- **Level 1** - who am I, and what do I want?
- **Level 2** - Who's my audience and what do they want?
- **Level 3** - What VALUE am I giving to MY AUDIENCE?

### Mission 1: Who Am I?
We're optimising for quantity in these exercises. The objective is to get stuff onto a page.

## Why Niche Down?
Niche down to blow up is the official stance of most YouTube growth coaches.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 21.59.20.png]]

Often niching down can help you channel unlock something special, but another thing to think about is how much you want to be niched down.

## What does my dream look like?
In a dream world, where you didn't have to worry about money, what sort of videos are you making?

![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.01.22.png]]

Can I define this dream channel in a way that is entirely within my control?

## What does my audience look like?
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.08.01.png]]

Once you figure out who you're making videos for, it's easier for figuring out your niche.

## Ali's Example
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.11.05.png]]

Medic Mo is like Ali five years ago, but less competent. He's a younger version of himself, but less good at doing all the things Ali does today.

## Value Proposition
Your value proposition should combine what you do with why you do it. Try and turn this into an introductory spiel that you can say in a couple of sentences.
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.16.26.png]]

The explicit value propositions is what you say out loud to your audience, and the implicit one is what you want people to think in their minds. The implicit value proposition is what you would want people to tell their friends about your channel.

## OK, Now What?
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.24.40.png]]
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 22.25.06.png]]

We seem to think that growing on YouTube is about targeting the niche, but there's an element of growth that comes from the audience connecting with you, and they connect with you better if they think you're having fun. It's very obvious when you're not having fun and this will harm your growth.

# Q&A
-   **At how many subs can you start to niche up again? I niched down and my channel grew to now 4K subs but whenever I make videos outside of my small niche, they get so few views. For fun, I want to start making different videos**
	-   When you adapt your niche, you will always take a hit in view count, but it's not all about view counts. If it was, you wouldn't be talking about having fun.
-   **Ali can you expand on the questions you ask yourself to make sure that the factors involved in your dream channel are within your control**
	-   Is it my own actions that control this, and it not then it's not within my control.
-   **Would you advise people who are beginners to repurpose their videos into blog posts and tweets like what you have on your notion template or not for now ?**
	-   If you're a beginner to YouTube, focus on YouTube. Adding in a repurposing layer makes it harder.
-   **How do you validate that Medic Mo exists in your audience?**
	-   I don't really, I just have a vibe. I know enough people in my audience share characteristics of Medic Mo based on conversations on social media.
-   **Do you ever make videos for specifically you today, rather than the less-competent you-from-five-years-ago? I have a niche in mind, but also feel like I’m going to want to make occasional videos outside of that**
	-   A bunch of my videos are guide rather than guru. If I make a video saying I recently learned about something and now I'm making a video on it, that's me making a video for myself today.
-   **Do you recommend having an explicit introduction in videos? If so, how do you strike the balance between explaining why people should listen to you (I'm a doctor, etc - things about YOU) and making the pitch about your audience and what THEY can get out your videos?**
	-   The question of intro vs no intro is a bit of a contraversal one. Different people have different opinions. Add an intro if the social proof of your credentials will benefit your video.
-   **Can I use a short as a hook to a longer video?**
	-   You could do a short that points the viewer to a longer video going into the topic of the short in more detail.
-   **Any suggestions on how to integrate shorts into our strategy? Should we do shorts in our main YT (how does lower avg watch time impact your channel authority?) or create a 2nd channel?**
	-   There's no penalty for having it on the main channel. I am personally going for the main channel.
	-   There's a bit of a balancing act. The audience for the shorts might not be interested in your long form content.
-   **Where do the shorts show up when we publish them on our youtube channel?**
	-   Depends where viewers are looking at them from. They will always be in the "Videos" feed. You can hide them from the main feed. If you're on mobile, shorts is a separate thing.
-   **Will you be sharing your creative workflow in Notion / Roam Research?**
	-   That's the points of weeks 3 and 4 of the course, and it'll be notion.
-   **I’m bilingual but my first language is French. Any advice if I should pick English with potentially more reach or pick French where I feel my content is underserved?**
	-   My instinct would be to stick to french.
	-   It also depends how strong your accent is, because if it's really strong then native English speakers might not have the patience to listen to it.
-   **Is there a way to organize your channel to not get cluttered by shorts?**
	-   You can organise then in playlists.
	-   Most people don't click on your channel and start browsing. Most of your videos will be seen on peoples homepages,, so it doesn't matter what your channel looks like.
-   **Is it legit, to upload a once produced short to YT, Instagram and TikTok?**
	-   Yes, we do that all the time and it works well.
-   **How effective is it to take a clip from a long video and turn it into a short?**
	-   It can be pretty effective. A lot of people are doing that, and blowing up because of doing that.
-   **Is it a bad idea to do shorts if you only have one video in your channel so far?**
	-   If you only have one video, there is so little you can do in the short term that will have an impact on your channel.
-   **How much did you audience impact your implicit statements in the beginning?**
	-   It impacted a lot. The audience I'm targeting and the content I'm making for them will influence my value propositions.
-   **How do you figure out is it your contents problem or is it the thumbnail/ topic problem that you aren’t growing ?**
	-   Usually it's a content problem. Thumbnail and title are the packaging and the content is the product. If the product is bad but the packaging is good, you're not going to grow. If the packaging is bad but the content is good, you'll grow slowly.
	-   There are two things I care about
		-   **Reach**. This is the test of how good the title and thumbnail are, and it is the percentage of people who saw my thumbnail on YouTube that clicked on it. If that number is very low, it suggests that title and thumbnail are performing poorly, though there are some topics that will perform badly anyway so you need to bear that in mind. 5-8% is considered average, and anything above 8% is considered good.
		-   **Watch time** and **watch duration**. This is a test of how good the content is.
	-   You need to ask yourself if the title and thumbnail are bad and people arne't clicking, or if the content is bad and people aren't watching.
	-   For most people, it's the content itself, and it so happens that the title and thumbnail also aren't very good. The more videos you make, focusing on marginal gains, the better your videos will be.
-   **What are your thoughts on using Shorts as a way to test content to turn into full videos?**
	-   That's reasonable. Because shorts are still new, you might have an idea that doesn't do well as a short might do quite well as a long form video.
-   **Is it possible to niche down to far? I’m not sure my audience is big enough?**
	-   It depends on your goals. If you care about hitting a million subscribers, then you need to focus on your niche. Generally though, no audience is too small to niche down on.
-   **Just out of curiosity, is YouTube advertising worth it?**
	-   If you're trying to advertise your own channel, then no.
	-   If you're trying to advertise your own product, then yes.
-   **What do you use to include animation/drawings in your videos? e.g. Like doodly?**
	-   I have a video on this in my skillshare class. I use the iPad.
-   **What is optimum info to put in video description? Are there any no nos? Also on the About page on Youtube? Should you niche down or describe your full profile?**
	-   It doesn't really matter. It's not going to make or break the video. Ask yourself what the viewer would appreciate in the description. The more viewer appreciate your channel, the more the algorithm will appreciate it.
-   **What value is there in responding to as many comments as possible on my videos? Would you recommend spending energy doing that?**
	-   In the early day, yes. Int he early day the people who comment on your videos are giving you the gift of their time and attention. If you reply to their comments, they'll feel good about themselves and come back and watch more.
