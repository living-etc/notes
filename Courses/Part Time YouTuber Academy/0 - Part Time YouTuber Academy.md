# Contents
The sections the notes are split into here aren't how they were delivered during the course, rather each week had a couple of sessions from Ali, a session from Elizabeth, a couple of guest workshops and a creator Q&A.

I've organized them this way because this is how I found it most valuable to consume them as an absolute beginner to YouTube. If you're in the same situation as me and are using these notes to find your way around creating videos, I'd recommend following them as they are organized here.

# Who should do this course?
Anyone wanting to create videos for YouTube and take it seriously. Taking it seriously doesn't have to mean focusing only on the business side of it, rather it is best done half way between business and hobby, in order to keep it fun.

You can be at any experience level and get value from this course. I started it with no videos and no channel, and came out of it with a regular upload habit. Other people in my cohort had relatively successful channels and were there for the more advanced lessons that I skipped as a beginner.

All the sessions are recorded, and you get lifelong access to all them, so as a beginner becomes more experienced they can come back and watch the advanced sessions when they're ready.

# Why did I do this course?
I've wanted to create a YouTube channel for a while now, and have had a couple of unsuccessful attempts in the past. The latest attempt wasn't going anywhere because I didn't know anything about getting started. 

By putting down the money for this course, I became committed to doing the homework each week, which was to upload a video, in order to get value for the expense, and it worked.

# How the course changed me
I can now call myself a "YouTuber", and am equipped with the tools needed to grow my channel if I put the work in. The feels like a gateway to the next stage of my life, which I'd been seeking for a number of years before I found this course.

# Practical application
The insights I've taken away from all of the lessons directly feed into my creative process. I'm reviewing them regularly and comparing my current output to what I've got written here so ensure I'm creating videos in the right way.
