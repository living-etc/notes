You do the work to create the work for yourself. Each video is a lottery ticket, and the more videos you have the more likely you to win.

Rules on titles:
- sell the result, not the process
- generate intrigue instead of agreement
- don't describe what your video is about
- optimize for humans, not machines
- A/B Testing

Three types of videos you can make:
- **discoverable** - discovered by people outside of your subscriber base
- **community** - develop greater connections with your videos, eg "a day in the life"
- **sales** - get the viewer to take action and go off to somewhere else

You need an intro for discoverable videos, because the audience don't know who you are. You don't need them for community or sales videos, because its aimed at your existing subscribers.

- What we do
- How we do it
- Why we do it

E.g. "I'm X and on this channel we do Y"

**FBR - Fast, Bad, Wrong**
- the mindset you should have when writing the video for the first time
- first draft should be all three of these things
- it helps you avoid perfectionism

**A roll vs voiceover**
- include some b-roll to make the video more visually engaging
- switching between a-roll and b-roll is an easy way to make the video more engaging
- your brain is good at filling in the gaps when you use random shots and have good voiceover.
- think about making the hook the b-roll with voice over, then jump into a roll for the intro

Tip: make a b-roll library. Whenever you film b-roll, split it up into 10 second clips and add it to the library.

**Minimize repetition**
- don't repeat yourself the way you would do in real life teaching.
- novel information is what gives the audience the dopamine hit.

**Flair**
- overhead sketching/writing is a good way to create flair
	- write/draw very slowly to get good handwriting and speed it up in post
- proof of work: show the effort you're putting in to make your video stand out fro m others
- a blurry moving foreground object is more engaging, can be accomplished using a camera slider.
- add handwritten animations overlaid to the video

**Intellectual property**
- if you're going to teach something, give it a name
	- e.g. "resonance calendar" is a library of things that have resonated with Ali over the years
	- for Ali's "how I remember everything I read", he gave the seven levels names from harry potter instead of just numbers
		- helps the viewers engage more because it's a personal thing from you
	- "progressive summarization" from Tiago Forte
	- "birdsong technique" and "coals mines" from this course
- it benefits the learner because something with a name sticks with them for longer

Most of Ali's videos have a triplet structure.
- Most things you're explaining can be broken down into three points

For example:

Quartet works really well for educational skills

Story for "How I date productively"
- Character: Ali

- Why can't they get it: they don't understand online dating
- Stake: need to find someone on a dating app or else they'll die alone
- Helps: book called "how to not die alone"
- How: talk about the 18 tips from the books read
- Transformed: been going on more dates than before

You could apply heros journey to anything, but you don't have to. It's best for a transformational video where you describe your viewers problem in a way that resonates with them

When the video ends, our only objective is to get the viewer to watch another video. Our viewers aren't loyal, and we need to convince them to watch another video before they realize the video is over. The people who got to the end of the video are your prime target audience, and are most likely to watch another video if you can sell it to them.

# Q&A
## How do you avoid people clicking off during your intro?


## Do you have any suggestions on how to “get rid of” subscribers who don’t like your content anymore? I have a big channel and like 90% of my subs done engage with my videos anymore (I’ve changed a lot over the years) I’m hoping that with consistently posting new stuff people will naturally fall off but I dont know if this is the best way to go about it.


## Any tips to spend a day creating Broll - do you just wonder around the city taking random footage, or create a shot list?


## How do you sync you audio and video if I’m recording with phone and using a Shure MV7 mic storing audio on my computer.


## How do you suggest we include the why in the intro?


## Any reason to do an intro instead of an outro
70% of people will see your intro but only 10% will see your outro


-   Thoughts on intros at the start of the video vs a reusable intro at the end of each video?
-   Does writing style (or tone of speaking) change for A roll v B roll?


## Could you explain the ‘we’ channel v ‘you’ channel v ‘I’ channel again?
"We" is community oriented, we're doing this together.
"I" is I do this thing, such as hauls
"You" is I teach you this

## What is the advantage of having your own library of b-roll versus using stock videos (if any)?
Proof of work. It's more interesting because it's footage of you rather than of some random person.

## How do you light overhead shots?
I don't.

## Do you track where they are all used in notion so you don’t overuse any one b-roll clip?
No one care. No one watches all your videos.

## Could this Listicle naming technique be used to name challenges/programs in the fitness/wellness space? Ex: a fitness blogger took a cardio regimen that’s been around for ages and packaged it as “12-3-30” and has gone completely viral
Yes. The better you name something, the more likely it is to go viral.

## If you’re making make educational videos (similar to Ali) should you use “I” or “you” in your title? For example: The 5 Magical Apps that Changed My Life VS. The 5 Magical Apps that can Change Your Life.
All of our highest performing videos are "I" titles rather than "you" titles.

## Any tips on how to improve speaking to the camera? Recommend a vocal coach?
Repetition is the main one. I've tried a load of vocal coaches, but none of them have help me speak on a camera. The best way to become comfortable on camera is to read your script to a mirror so you have a dry run before you record.

## I think viewers tend to click on videos with thumbnails with celebrities, influencers, etc. So, is having my face in the thumbnail or having content related images in the thumbnail good for the video?
It depends. There's no science. It depends on your niche and your vibe.

## For your future VLOG videos. Will they follow a hero journey structure? Or something different?
Vlogs are hard enough to impose a story structure onto them.

## To have a sales pitch at the end of your video, does that mean you have to have a lot of videos already on your channel? Which means you can only do that later?
As long as you have at least one video you can recommend another video.

## Does recommending a playlist perform better than a specific video?
Yes, but as long as it's a short.

## How do you decide which video/playlist to pitch ? Relevancy/boosting a underperforming video/pitching a ‘tried and true’ video?
General relevance. If someone's gotten to the end of a video on relationships, you should recommend something similar.

## Do you have a flow diagram/ map for which vid have been used for the end screens? What is the process?


## Thoughts on asking users to like and subscribe? Or is that so 2018
No point.

## When is it a good time to start implementing the End Screen? How many videos should you have before you even bother?
1

## Can we keep making a hundred listicle videos(less scripted) and still expect the viewers to get a lot of value or also focus on making heavily researched videos once a month?
There's not a correlation between how well researched the video is and how valuable it is. 

## How can I add story telling to a programming (tech in general) videos?
You can always incorporate storyteling elements into things, but if you're doing a four hour video teaching python to beginners, you don't need to tell a story. Just teach them python.

## In your opinion, what's the most underutilised or neglected form of structure for videos that could help us create great videos abnormally quickly?
The listicle where you speak from the heart is how you generate videos abnormally quick.

## What sort of structure would a tutorial follow?
Either a heros journey or the quartet, but it depends on the tutorial. "How to learn to code" was a tutorial, and we saw it could follow the triplet formula.

## How do I use the 'I' when I am a teacher teaching students?
You're presenting yourself as a guru, so you're leading with authority so use the "you".

## Would you recommend hiring a videographer for a couple of days to shoot all brolls…? Specially for beginners with camera
