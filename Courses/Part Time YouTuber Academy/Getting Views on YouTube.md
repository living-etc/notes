# Insights
- A channel will gain the majority of its views from YouTube recommending videos to people, either on their personal homepage or after they have watched another video.
- Getting views for your content is above getting viewers through a **funnel**.
- The funnel starts with earning the click, which you do with your **title** and **thumbnail**. You need to tell them potential viewer a compelling story using your title and thumbnail in the half second they're going to be seeing it.
- Your title and thumbnail will be seen by approximately **33x** the number of people who will actually click on it.
- Once you've earned the click, you need to hook them with a strong intro to keep them from clicking off.
- The first second of your video will be seen by **2-3x** the number of people that see your last second.

# Notes
```ad-note
title: Note for anyone who has come across these notes

The advice given in this workshop is all the views of Charlie from Charisma on Command. The advice here is what goes into creating videos on his channel, which might not be how we want to create our content.

There's a lot of interesting lessons in here for any channel, but most of it is intended for creating videos that are interesting to the mass market.

My channel's niche is tech workers (software engineers, etc) so my content will never be interesting to people outside of the tech industry.

As I said above, there's a lot of useful learnings in here but others (such as having a high emotion face on the thumbnail) I'm going to leave out.

## Format
Potential formats:
- **Talking head** - turn on your camera and talk to it, giving it information.
- **Breakdown/Analysis** - talk about something that's int he public consciousness and talk about it with a lot of b-roll
- **Animated videos**
- **Interview/gimmick** - interviews, with an added layer of something that makes it fun to watch.
- **Vlogs**
- **Music videos**
- **Hidden camera/pranks** - these can be wildly successful
- **Live**
- **Game shows**
- **Demonstrations**
- **Tier lists** - this is especially good for young channels, where people don't know you. The audience will be more interested in "top 10 productivity hacks" rather than "how I do productivity"
- **Reactions**

Talking head was very successful in the early days of YouTube. What is working today is reactions.

### Famejacking
You can piggy back on some huge cultural thing that's happening right now and use it to get your video more views.

The topic your video starts on doens't have to be the one it ends on. You start with the cultural piece you use to bring people in, than move to the thing you actually want to talk about.

Don't rush to insert what you want to talk about into the title, you don't need to be so upfront with it. Also, be careful not to create click bait. You still need to deliver on the original promise of the title.

### Topic
The video on the right below was cranked out quicker than the one on the left but weas more successul. This is because the topic of it was timely, and people were interested in it.
![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.14.32.png]]

Make the content for your audience, give them something that will help them. You can talk about celebrities, but use that in the content and have the title be about the audience.

Flash in the pan trends don't have longevity. Make the tile one that will be valid eternally.
![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.17.14.png]]

When creating a topic for your video, make it:
- for your audience
- long lasting
- trending

> My personal thoughts - don't always worry too much about the trending thing. This is if you want something like 1M views in 24 hours.

Using a content calendar can help you shape content around big cultural events.

### Title
Title planning comes before making the content. This is a big different between professionals and amateurs. The more pro you get, the more time you spend on this.

Learn the **power words** in your niche. Search for videos in your niche and check out high view videos relative to subscribers. The higher the view count relative to the subscriber count is what you're after.

You can also take someone else's title and rework it to be your own. In doing do, you can take their idea without ripping off their content.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.26.31.png]]

Advice for titles:
- don't keyword stuff - optimize for humans, not the algorithm
- keep it around 56 characters

Try combining power words and structures to create strong titles.

### Thumbnail
![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.40.31.png]]

Thumbnail is the biggest thing to affect your click-through rate. Putting effort into the thumbnail is what brings people to your content. You need to be putting loads of effort into the front of the funnel.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.42.30.png]]

Things that go wrong:
- Repeating the text of the title on the thumbnail. Instead, the text in the thumbnail should add to the title
- Doesn't grab attention
- doesn't match the title
- doesn't create a mystery or tell a story

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.49.20.png]]

Thumbnail tips:
- Five words max. None is OK too.
- If you have a colour that deosn't pop from the background, it can be helpful to add a stroke
- Have a gradient as the background colour (again, optional)
- High emotion faces
- High contract colours
- Create your title and thumbnail _before_ shooting

### Content/Charisma
**Crunchy framing** boost enjoyment and recall, helping bring people back to your channel.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 19.02.39.png]]
Giving something a name help people store and recall what you said, without needing to remember all the details.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 19.03.01.png]]
The specificity make sit more impactful and memorable

![[Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 19.03.28.png]]
Help add substance to your message by contrasting it with the opposite of what you mean.

Crunchiness make thumbnail text easy.
- Add the TM thing to your thumbnail to create instant mystery
- Show the two contrasting things in the thumbnail

#### Hook with a strong intro
33x more people will see your thumbnail than your first second, but also 2-3x more people will see your first second than your last, so you need to spend more time on your introduction than you do on the rest of your video to get viewers engaged.

Useful ways to start a video:

The camera subtracts 10 points of enthusiasm. Something that is engaging and interesting in real life is going to be less interesting on YouTube. For 99% people of on the planet, you're going to need to ratchet up your personality for your videos. For talking head content, find a persona and tap into their personality.

If you're doing a voiceover, you must gesticulate. You must perform even though you're not on camera.
