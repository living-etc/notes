Youtube doesn't recognize niches, it just follows customer behaviour. As a consumer, you don't pick a category any other way than watching the content. You don't choose a category you're into the way you do when you join a website like Quora.

Likewise for creators, it's our audience that decide our niche, not us. Our niche is decided by the people that watch our videos.

Youtube doesn't care about niches.
Viewers care about niches.
Youtube cares about viewers.

# The two types of niche
There are two possible niches:
- what you talk about
	- attracting and educating/entertaining people with the same interests as you
- you
	- your personality is your niche

```ad-note
Got told in the breakout room that I have great screen presence and a great accent, and I should capitalise on them.

#todo learn about screen presence
