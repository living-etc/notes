# Insights
- YouTube is not a way to get rich quickly, rather you can get rich slowly on the platform if you are willing to put the work in over a long period of time.
- On average, it takes about 150 videos for a channel to reach 1000 subscribers, which is the threshold at which YouTube allows you to start monetizing your content.
- If you upload one video per week, as many channels so, this will take you approximately three years to reach, and the revenue from 1000 subscribers still won't be enough for you to quit your job (if that's you're goal).
- Advice for people starting on YouTube is to be intrinsically motivated, rather than extrinsically, that is to be motivated by the pleasure of creating and uploading videos, rather than targeting subscriber counts.
- A healthy goal for YouTube is to create one video per week and to get gradually better over time. Each video does not need to be better than the last, since that's very difficult and is a recipe for burnout.
- The biggest element of success on YouTube is luck. You need your videos to be chosen by the algorithm to be present to other users. Think of each video as a lottery ticket, and each time you upload, you have a slightly better chance of winning.
- You can generate your own luck by stacking the deck in your favour in three different ways: **time**, where you devote a large amount to, for example, researching and writing videos; **money**, where you invest money in, for example, better gear or outsourcing parts of the process; and **developing a system** to reduce the amount of busywork that you put into each video, making you more productive.
- Time and money are based on individual circumstances, so this course is about helping develop a system for producing videos.

# Notes
## Sign up for twitter
YouTube is a one to many broadcast platform, whereas twitter facilitates one to one conversations. You don't make friends through YouTube, rather you make friends with people on Twitter. You'll even make friends with other YouTube creators through Twitter.

## Is it worth being on YouTube today?
Yes, because YouTube is only growing each year.
![[PTYA 1.1 - Being on YouTube in 2021.png]]

## Hobby vs Business
Treating it as a business is about making the videos the audience want, whereas treating it as a hobby is about making the videos you want.

It's possible to do both, and create some videos for yourself and others for your audience.

## What is success on YouTube?
![[PTYA 1.1 - Success On YouTube.png]]

But this is not easy.

![[PTYA 1.1 - Skills You Need As A YouTuber.png]]

There are university degree and fulltime jobs doing each of these skills, and YouTubers need to be good at all of them.

## Success on YouTube
Need to spend a lot of time to see significant results - it's a compounding effect.

![[PTYA 1.1 - What It Takes To Success On YouTube.png]]

Need to stick around long enough to see the compounding effect. You're unlikely to see results until at least a year in when you have developed the skills enough to create good quality videos.

## Goals
Focus on input goals, such as creating one video per week, rather than outcome goals, such as having 100k subscribers in a year.

You don't go to the gym twice then complain you don't have six pack abs.

## Perspective
![[PTYA 1.1 - How Many Videos Do You Need To Make?.png]]

These numbers are demoralizing if you have outcome-based goals. With input-based goals you focus on the journey rather than the destination.

These numbers come from tubebuddy. These stats can be a bit skewed by channels that post multiple time per day, but the order of magnitude is still correct.

## What does it take to succeed on YouTube
![[PTYA 1.1 - What Do You Need To Succeed On YouTube?.png]]

- **Luck** - every video you create is like buying a lottery ticket. The more videos you produce, the more likely it is that the algorithm will find it and cause it to blow up. You often have to be in the right place at the right time to blow up on YouTube, and social media in general.
- **Work** - you need to be willing to produce videos consistently for a long period of time while also getting better at going so.
- **Unfair advantages** - time and money are two types of unfair advantages. Spending money on this course is an unfair advantage.

## Stacking the deck
Success on YouTube is probabilistic, and you can stack the deck in your favour in several ways:
- **time** - you can spend a lot of time scripting your videos or learning production processes that will make your videos stand out.
- **money** - you can use money to buy better kit or to outsource parts of the process, like editing and researching.
- **system** - you can use a system to streamline your process and templatise it to minimize the sunk costs and grunt work per video.

## The System
The course is about helping the student build a system for creating videos.
![[PTYA 1.1 - The System.png]]

## Week 1 Homework
**My Favourite Thing** - Don't worry about the topic. It's only a prompt if you can't come up with a video idea. If you already have an idea, then use that.

It's easier to document than to create, that is to document something you are already doing. It's easy to do because it's just talking about something you're already doing, rather than creating something new. Being able to talk about something you already know, such as your favourite thing, is very easy.

# Q&A
**Any suggestions on how to do YouTube as a business but keep it fun? Or to avoid making it a business you treat like a hobby?** 
It's a case of finding the things that make things fun for you. Things like:
- gamification
- autonomy - making things about stuff you want to talk about. Some youtubers use "one for me, one for them"
- master - the more you do the thing, the better you get and the more fun it gets
- environment - build the environment you'll work in so you enjoy being in it
- social - network with other people in roughly the same space as you

**If you're avoiding outcome based expectations in the context of YouTube success, what is a more rewarding expectation to have?** 
For Ali, making one video per week that he's proud of is success. When going to the gym, just showing up was a win for him.

Have input goals that are entirely within your control.

**In your early videos, how long was it taking you to script, record, and edit?**
Script - 10 minutes
Record - 1 hour for 20 minutes video
Editing - 4-6 hours per video on average

Editing is always what takes the most time, which is why outsourcing editing is always a valuable thing to do.

**I struggle to articulate what problem I’m solving for my viewers. My channel is on Kung Fu. Any advice?** 
Going to talk about this in another session.

**How do I get the absolute most out of this course? If I want to sink as many hours into YT this 6 weeks, what should I prioritize? (I like a competitive spirit and want to do my best)** 
To get the most out of the course, do one video per week and take the feedback on it and work it into the next one. Take feedback from the PTYA team as well as do some self reflection.

**Any tips on how to make a noob YouTube setup work for you? i.e.. Audience finds it endearing that you record with a potato and and don’t spend time scripting/editing** 
You can record with a potato camera, but you have to then lean on other parts more heavily, like your personality. We'll talk about gear in production value in the next session.

**Nick Lewis talked about targeting YouTube search when he was first growing on YouTube. do you have any tips on how to decide which videos to make in order to rank in search?** 
Two different strategies:
- target people just browsing
- target people searching for something specific

In the early days of a channel, it can be valuable to find out what people are searching for and target that. Type something into the YouTube search box to see the auto-complete options, or use a tool like tubebuddy.

**How soon should I niche down vs. trying out all of my channel direction & video ideas?** 
It's a huge "it depends". If you want to grow faster, you should niche down faster, but you need to balance that with what you find fulfilling. This is good for the business side, but doesn't account for the human side and keeping you engaged as a creator.

**I have really good concepts, but I'm struggling to refine concepts into great scripts?** 
Stay tuned for week three of the course where we talk about this.

**If you are using YouTube as a marketing channel to push people to your website, are you still as concerned about subscribers? I reference YouTube for tutorials and have never subscribed to a channel** 
Whether or not you're concerned about subscribers also depends on your goal. For example, if you are a lawnmower repair channel, you're targeting people who are trying to fix their lawn mower. They have a specific problem they want solved, and in that case you don't care about subscribers. The metrics you care about would be something like people signing up to your website.

Subscriber count isn't that big a deal anyway. Its pretty much a vanity metric.

**I know you and your teams assess your analytics quite frequently - what would you say makes a good thumbnail? Because we have some people like Matt d’Avella who can post their face, a laptop and some airpods, and absolutely smash it, but if I do that, the only viewer, will be my mum** 
We'll talk about thumbnails in future sessions.

In general though "your vibe attracts your tribe". What is the sort of thumbnail your target audience would be interested in clicking.

**I have a channel for my video podcast, if I want to make actual YouTube videos should I start a new channel** 
It's a big "it depends". Most people would have separate channels, but it depends on your specific use case. Will you have different audiences for each channel, for example?

**But how soon into being on YouTube would you recommend outsourcing editing? Wouldn’t you also want to get in the reps for editing as well?** 
I think you should edit your first five videos, than outsource the rest.

**What is the mindset or headspace we should be in to manage the “pain” of starting from zero?** 
Don't look at the numbers. The numbers are irrelevant. Make one video per week, and improve a little but over time. You only feel pain from expectations, so if you have no expectations for growth, you won't have the pain.

**For non-beginners what is one thing you can do to produce two videos a week? (How did you jump to that level?)**
Figure out what the bottlenecks are in your process, and delegate them away. This will usually be editing, followed by writing and researching.

**What is your lowest point in your YouTube career (enough to make you quit) and how did you overcome it?** 
Never wanted to quit.

**My YouTube videos as recordings of zoom classes I teach with PowerPoint. How do you make those higher quality when uploading as zoom quality is not tops?** 
You generally have to adapt your content to the platform, and you're unlikely to stand out on YouTube with repurposed zoom recordings.

**How to start prioritizing making videos when everything seems to take priority - exhaustion after work is the main thing. How to break through that tiredness and push and create** 
If I'm feeling too tired to create a video, lower the bar as much as possible. Just make a crappy video, but make a video. Anyone can make a crap video. It's only when we worry about making a good video that it becomes hard. Your first 100 videos will be crap anyway.

**Do you recommend doing #SHORTS videos for the channel?**
Yes and no. It depends on what your strategy is. Generally, shorts are doing well, so you could do some shorts in additional to normal videos, but they aren't really a substitute for a normal video

**How can I add personality to a teaching english channel, my channel is preparing students for the IELITS exam so its a serious channel but I want to add personality to keep viewers engaged but I don't know how** 
Find other YouTube channels you like and try to copy their delivery style. I tried to copy Peter McKinnon in my early days, and it was my failure to emulate him that helped me develop my own style.

**What are you metrics for success on YouTube? Views/subs/engagement/revenue/profit, personal fulfillment, etc.?** 
The metrics I pretend not to care about are subscriber count and revenue.
