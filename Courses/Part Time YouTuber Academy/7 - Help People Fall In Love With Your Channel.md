# Aesthetic
Three things everyone should have in their background:
- bookshelf
- lamps
- plants

The background should match the vibe of your channel.
- A peter mckinnon, grungy alpha male vibe might be darker with a worn, grungy electric guitar
- A matt d'avella vibe is light, aesthetic and minimalist

- be really intentional with the design of your space and think about the personality you want to bring across
- you're not trying to appeal to everyone, you're not trying to be vanilla ice cream, which is acceptable to most people but loved by few

# Branding
Background music
- Fade it down over time, but don't fade it out entirely. This lets the audience notice the music at the start but then move it out the way over time.

# Confidence and Delivery
Don't go into British Airways mode, which is the voice you put on when you're doing the voice over, or when you're patronizing a classroom full of five year olds.

YouTube audiences are built on parasocial relationships, where each member of the audience thinks the creator is speaking only to them, and that they have a personal relationship together.

Another tip is to speak through a smile. This is a really easy way of leveling up your persona.

Also try working jokes into your scripts.

## To Script Or Not To Script
Don't fully script the video. It takes too long.

Better to half script - script the important part like the hook and just have a list of bullet points for the body. This way you come across more authentic and appear more engaging.

It takes a lot of practice to deliver a scripted video in an engaging manner. This was the frustration of the video I shot for homework 3. If I was doing it by bullet points it might have been less frustration.

Best to bullet the whole thing, including the hook.

Ali scripts his shorts and reads off each sentence then edits them together, but just wings the longer ones.
