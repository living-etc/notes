# Insights
- In order to upload one video per week and still have a full life, you need to optimize your production process. This is done by turning your contents ideas into a **content calendar** with which you plan your video uploads in advance, and from there you can work back to optimizing the earlier stages of the process.
- Two key elements of this optimization are a kanban board and slow burn projects. A **kanban board** allows you to visualize your production workflow, allowing you to surface and resolve the bottlenecks as you move your ideas through your process. **Slow burn** is where you have multiple projects in progress at once, but only doing small amounts of work on each periodically, contrasted with the **heavy lift** of doing an entire video from zero to published in a single sitting.
- Maintaining a calendar with your future content scheduled in gives your brain a nudge that you need to work on it, reducing the friction in getting the videos completed.
- The production workflow can generally be broken into five key stages which are optimized like so:
	- **Idea Generation**. Use the idea generation methods described in [[4 - Generate Endless Content Ideas]]. Categorizing your channels content with **content buckets**, where each video slots into a single broad category, are also helpful.
	- **Writing**. Make use of pockets of time you find around your life to do small amounts of work on some of your videos.
	- **Filming**. Batch your filming, so you film multiple videos on a single day.
	- **Editing**. Outsourcing to an external editor is an excellent way to free up your time. If you don't outsource it, then batch this as well. Maintaining a b-roll library also helps with adding flair to the video.
	- **Publishing**. Use something like vidiq to automate the metadata for your video, such as tags if you use them. You can also use an end screen template to reduce time there
- General advice is to do idea generation and writing in pockets of time throughout your day, and filming and editing in batches.

# Notes
The point of this session is to turn out content home base into a content calendar.

## Systemise Your Production
### The Power of Kanban
A kanban board, shown below, allows you to take all the production resources related to your video and confine them to a card that you move through your production process.

As well as helping you move things into production, it also helps you identify the bottlenecks.

 ### Slow Burn
Imagine being a chef with multiple pots on a cooker, each one on a low eat. You occasionally have to stir each one or add another ingredient, and sometimes you'll take it off and add the next pot.

When applied to creative output such as YouTube, this takes the form of having multiple projects in progress at once without being actively worked on. We will dip into each one occasionally if we have an idea related to it, or if we're visiting it as part of a review of our productivity system. In working like this, we never have to start a project from scratch and see it through to completion all at once, which is a **heavy lift**. Instead we have multiple **slow burn** projects.

### The Opposite of Distraction is Traction
If we have something in our calendar, such as a video, then we will be drawn to take action on it. It gives our brain a nudge that we need to do it.

## Strategies For Production
There are five broad stages of the creation process for youtube videos.

The only one of these that requires a large span of uninterrupted time is filming. Editing will benefit from having time to get into the headspace for it, but it isn't essential. The others can be done in small pieces here and there.

For example, if you have gaps between meetings at work, you might take 10-20 minutes to come up with ideas or write scripts. You could do this even if you only have as little as 30 seconds to spare.

Doing this means that when you do get uninterrupted time, you already have a load of videos ready to be filmed. This is where batching comes in, identifying the part of the production process that takes the longest (filming) and streamlining it as much as possible.

Thinking about content in terms of buckets, which is broad categories, is useful for two reasons.
1. There is evidence that the YouTube algorithm categorizes videos into buckets, so if it thinks a video is about productivity, it will show it to other people who it knows watch productivity videos.
2. It makes it easier for you to plan and organize your channel content if, for example, you decide to put out one book club video, one productivity video and two relationship videos per month.

Your content buckets can be more than what you advertise on your branding. In the example of Ali's content buckets below, "Personal" isn't something advertised on the channel, and "Book Club" covers books that fit into the other buckets, so those two buckets can be kept private and used as an organizational tool for planning content.

In the example below, a Book Review would be a content type which would fit into one of the content buckets.

 Creating a series of videos all based on the same format make it easy for you to create content for them because you're only having to fit content into a predefined template.

## Writing And Filming
![[Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 22.05.03.png]]
Overthinking is the thing that stops you, so think in terms of bullet points in terms of prose, and just get things put down on paper when you have the spare time.

The reason we don't do something is because it's hard, so if we optimize to minimize the friction, it will become easier to do.

There are two types of friction:
- **environmental** - we can overcome this easily by engineering our environment. For example, if we are put off filming because of the effort needed to set up the studio, then find ways to leave parts of it already set up.
- **emotional** - this is things like impostor syndrome. We won't talk about it here. We'll focus on the environment friction.

- Get a tripod that works instead of propping your camera up against some books
- Ceiling mount your lights so you don't have to spend 20 minutes setting up your light each time and instead you just turn it on.

![[Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 22.11.43.png]]
If you plan to film 8 videos on a particular day, you can make sure you have all the videos ready to film by then. Same principle as for creating the content calendar, where having the thing in your calendar nudges your brain to think about doing it.

## Editing And Publishing
![[Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 22.13.43.png]]
1. Having a b-roll library is an easy way to add flair to your video
2. Use frame.io if you're working with an editor

![[Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 22.17.09.png]]
1. Use vidiq to automate your tags
2. Use an end screen template

## General Advice
- Do **Idea Generation** and **Writing** in pockets of time
- Do **Filming** and **Editing** in batches

# Q&A
-   **Tips for struggling with an editor as they are using Premier Pro and I'm using Final Cut Pro**
	-   We don't send the proxy files, we just send the raw footage over.
	-   If you're going to use proxy files, you have to use something like Adobe MEdia Encoder to turn them into a reasonable proxy files.
	-   Generally you want to get an editor who uses the same software as you.
	-   Also try upgrading your internet connection so you can upload large files faster.
-   **When did you decide to move to YouTube full time, was it passion or money related?**
	-   The advice I would give is don't quit the job unless you have enough money to sustain yourself.
	-   I did a video talking about my decision to do YouTube fulltime.
-   **How much sleep did you get in order to sustain your business and avoid burnout?**
	-   It wans't a struggle to sleep 7 or 8 hours per night, and I had a social life.
	-   I think there's a vibe among the internet gurus to lionize the struggle, and I think it wasn't a struggle because I was doing everything possible to optimize the process and make it as fun as possible.
	-   When it's fun, productivity takes care of itself.
-   **Do you use content buckets to identify gaps in content or do you use them to generate more content ideas?**
	-   It's not very elaborate, it's more of a gut feeling thing. We know we need to shift to creating content in the buckets of where we're shifting to while still making the other videos, so we just see what we haven't made in a while. I see it as a guideline rather than a rule to move to our new content buckets.
-   **What if an idea doesn't lead to a script that is long enough, do you scrap it ?**
	-   The shorter the video, the more buzzfeedy it is. I don't like publishing a video less than 10 minutes long because the shorter the video the less in depth it is. That's just me though.
	-   There's no perfect length for a video. If you can get your message across in three minutes, then go for it.
-   **Advice if I niched down too early, can I still do videos on other topics**
	-   It depends if you care more about the business side of youtube or the arts side? Do you want to focus on growing or having fun.
	-   You can create content for your topic while growing your audience, and think about how you can weave your other topic into it.
	-   If I'm making videos for medical students, but I then want to make videos about tech, then let me make videos about tech for medical students.
-   **Is the norm after a certain threshold that every big channel has a larger team than you would expect?**
	-   The huge channels all have a team. Any channel that is good at the business side of YouTube has a team.
	-   Occasionally there will be someone who gets big and continues to do it all themselves because they love the craft.
-   **Do you allocate a day for a particular aspect of video production e.g. Monday scripting, Tuesday filming**
	-   We have dedicated filming days and work back from that.
-   **Advice on plugs to mailing list rather than to the next video**
	-   Plugs to mailing lists are a good thing to do, but not at the end of the video.
	-   Have some sort of call to action in the video to get people to sign up to your mailing list.
	-   It's also generally considered not good to have too many "sales" videos.
-   **Advice for being both a Podcaster and YouTuber**
	-   I think it's easier to succeed as being a professional youtuber than a professional podcaster, but that's a broad brushstroke thing.
	-   If you want to be both, people advice splitting the podcast episodes from the main channel.
	-   The people who want to watch a two hour podcast episode aren't the same ones who want to watch a 15 minute video.
-   **What's your strategy on repurposing podcast content into other content?**
	-   Broadly, anytime there's an interesting moment form the podcast we turn it into a clip and put it on Instagram, Tiktok, etc.
	-   It's a very labour intensive process though, so if you have the money I'd recommend outsourcing it.
-   **When you have success in a specific area, do you think you should do a separate channel for new content ?**
	-   Some people say separating shorts channels from main channels, others say keep them on the same one.
	-   It depends on what your audience want.
-   **How do you decide how often to make videos, quantity vs quality?**
	-   This is a bit nuanced. I don't like mentioning this at the start of the course because it gives people the wrong idea.
	-   When I say quantity matters, it doesn't really.
	-   What you want to do is make a good video.
	-   All things being equal, you want to make one good video every month, rather than one bad video every week.
	-   In order to know how to make a good video, you have to produce a lot of bad videos.
	-   Before you get good, you have to get going.
	-   If making a good video will take longer than a week, then take the time. There's nothing magical about making one video per week.
	-   Keep on the quantity thing until you learn how to make a good video.
	-   For context, I was a quantity guy until about a month ago, and I've been doing this for four years, and I'm really glad I spent those years focusing on quantity.
-   **How do you adjust video process for Vlogmas, what needs to give?**
	-   I would plan out my 30 videos in advance
	-   Then plan a filming days for batches of them
	-   I would sit down to film and not let myself eat until I've filmed a video, then reward myself with a slice of pizza.
-   **How to use YouTube as leverage for a business that teaches GP registrars to pass exams**
	-   I would seed my channel with my first 30 videos being general videos for GP registrars taking the exam.
	-   Once I've gone past the exam tips, I would branch out.
	-   Can I be the go to guy for general medical students, talking about medical issues from the point of view of a GP.
	-   Then when I had an audience of medical students and GP registrars who were committed to me, I could then sell them courses.
-   **What's your opinion on deleting videos?**
	-   I don't really have a clear answer to this for your situation.
-   **Did you have any signs that your videos were good which kept you going producing more videos in the early stages of YouTube?**
	-   I didn't show my videos to anyone because my friends and family weren't my target audience.
	-   I decided to make videos for two years and try to make them good.
	-   I had metrics that were going up slowly, which was the feedback I needed to know they were getting better.
	-   YouTube is good at feeding you these little morsels of stuff, such as the occasional comment saying the video was really helpful.
-   **How do you categorise for your viewers? Title alone or do you make the type of video explicit for which bucket it belongs to?**
	-   The viewers are the ones who will categorise your content so trying to make it as likely as possible to appeal to a certain niche/audience
