# Insights
- This session covers five different techniques for generating content ideas
	1. **Eureka moments**. When we have a video idea, get it written down as quickly as possible before you lose it.
	2. **Birdsong Technique**. Spotting the seed of an idea in other content. Something you can only do once you become a content creator. When you come across a piece of content that could be a video idea, save that content for later review.
	3. **Coal Mining**. Same as birdsong technique but for specific content creators. Where birdsong technique is about, for example, scrolling through your Twitter feed or a particular tag, coal mining is about going through the feed of a particular account. Same as with birdsong, when you find an idea that resonates, save it.
	4. **Five Months of Content in Five Minutes**. This is where you write down two lists: 5-10 things my audience want to know and 5-10 things I want to teach. With the overlapping lists, you write down all the steps needed to learn the thing, and those are your video ideas.
	5. **Ask The Audience**. Ask on social media what your audience wants to hear.
	6. **Ethical Analytica**. There are three ways to use analytics tools
		1. type into the YouTube search box a topic idea and use the autocomplete suggestions for ideas.
		2. Use analytics from YouTube Studio to find out what other channels your audience is watching.
		3. Use an extension like TubeBuddy or VidIQ.
	7. **Ship30's Endless Idea Generator**. A technique from the Ship 30 For 30 writing course. Best understood from the slides further down.
- When taking ideas from other peoples content, be careful to only rip off the idea and not the content itself. Ideas are never original, but the way in which they are presented can be. Always be aware of presenting ideas in your own way, which is itself originality, rather than repeating the other creators work.
- If you're basing your video ideas on other peoples ideas, then be sure to consume from many sources in order to get a broad ranges of ideas.

# Notes
## The Idea Generation Machine
![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 19.31.05.png]]

There's a seventh one in the session that isn't on here because it was added to the course only this morning.

## Technique 1 - Eureka moments
> Your brain is having ideas, not for holding them
> -- David Allen

Eureka moments are where an idea suddenly have an idea. The human brain is terrible at storing these ideas,  so we need to write them down as soon as we possible can.

## Technique 2 - Birdsong Technique
This is where we are able to spot potential video ideas in many other pieces of content. The name comes from how most people can't tell one birdsong from another, but those people who have studied the songs of different birds can tell them apart.

Applying this to video creation, those who have created content before are able to spot the seeds of a piece of a new piece of content within another in a way that other can't.

Copy ideas but not content. This could mean reading the title of an article or video without consuming the content so you aren't influenced by it

```ad-note
Don't consume too much of a source when doing this. Just steal the idea (title) and do your own spin on it so you don't accidentally rip off their content.
```

### Originality of Ideas
There are no original ideas, only existing ideas with a new spin, and each of us is able to spin them all slightly differently through our lived experiences and the lens through which we consume them.

You don't have to say original things, as long as you say them in your own voice. That itself is originality. -- Ali's writing coach

There are no original messages, only original messengers.

## Technique 3 - Coal Mining
> The people you follow on Twitter are the thoughts you're going to have months from now
> -- Mark Manson

Find original sources. Don't be a derivative of a derivative, instead find the works cited by your coal mine and talk about that. It makes your content more interesting and stops you coming across as a cookie cutter creator copying the bigger creators.

> We can't all get rich out of selling each others shoes

## Technique 4 - Five Months of Content in Five Minutes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtaxQw1lQjI

### Exercise
Create two lists:
- 5-10 things your target audience would want to learn
	- If you don't know you're target audience, then it's you 3/5/10 years ago. Think about what you wanted to know some number of years ago and create videos that answer them.
	- For me, this is me in my year at Student Beans
		- What would have helped me back then?
- 5-10 things you would want to teach.

For each item in these lists, write down the various questions that someone would have in order to learn that. Each of those is a video idea. For example:

![[Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 20.10.33.png]]

In the two minutes of this exercise, we came up with 14 video ideas.

Product-Market fit is a business moves from the "throwing spaghetti at the wall" phase of their lifecycle having established themselves in the market and can start growing, having identified a problem they can solve. With YouTube, this is the Creator-Audience fit, and the more these two lists overlap, the more creator-audience fit you will naturally have.

## Technique 5 - Ask The Audience
- Post on Twitter/Instagram
- Ask friends and family
	- Try Caroline and Dan
	- Try Ari and Danny
	- Try Aaron

## Technique 6 - Ethical Analytica
### Use analytics from YouTube Studio
Look at things like other videos that have high views and subscribers. See if there are any videos there that you can steal like above. videos that have done really well for other people can also do well for you.

You can also redo some of your old videos. Most of your audience will never have seen your old videos, so it's OK to recycle ones that either did well before or you think will do better today.

Use the "other videos that your audience watched" tab.

### Use YouTube search and suggestions
Search for "how to..." (for example) in youtube and look for the videos that are performing disproportionately well for the channels subscriber count. Look for a big multiplier between the two, so a view count that is 10x the subscriber count is an idea to steal.

### Use an extension
TubeBuddy or Vid IQ. Ali recommends TubeBuddy.

Helps you generate ideas for videos.

TubeBuddy is good for targeting search terms, but the way you blow up on YouTube is through the recommended or suggested videos.

# Q&A
## Should you create in depth videos on a topic or jump from topic to topic?


# Q&A
-   **How do you go about expanding an initial idea into a full-length video? I've got a lot of initial seed ideas but struggle with going from that to something like a ten-minute video.**
	-   We're going to be covering this, where we talk about turning ideas into scripts.
	-   Generally, the questions isn't about how to I turn this into 10 minutes, rather it's how do I teach this to someone. You want to ask yourself how you can explain this idea to someone else in a way they will understand it.
-   **After brainstorming, I came up with 3 possible niche ideas for my channel. What is the most effective way to test each niche out? Should I alternate between niches each week? Or should I stick to a niche for say, 6 weeks (6 videos) and then try another niche? For context my niches are: Reading books, journaling in a notebook and exam prep for 2 exams that I did well in.**
	-   Look at what other channels are doing in those niche and see if there's anything you can do. Generally, you will only really know if you can create videos in a niche by trying it.
-   **How should I create a call to action about a storytelling course that I am producing. I was also wondering about giving people free access to it if they sign up for my email newsletter.**
	- Generally don't. Use the end of your video to plug another video, so people stay on your channel.
	- You can do a "mid roll" plug where you direct viewers to something relevant to what you've just been talking about before moving on to the rest of the video.
-   **Is the basic notion plan good enough? What plan do you suggest for an individual with a small team?**
	-   Yes, it's good enough
	-   The team plan is good
-   **Is there a way that you integrate Apple notes or drafts with notion?**
	-   No, I just copy and paste.
-   **What is the general rule of thumb for toeing the line between drawing inspiration from other creators vs. stealing concepts/ideas. Especially because it seems like every video topic has been done at some point.**
	-   Don't be a derivative of a derivative, instead find the works cited by other creators and talk about that. It makes your content more interesting and stops you coming across as a cookie cutter creator copying the bigger creators.
-   **Would you follow people in your industry or things that are interesting to you or both**
	-   Both
-   **Should we use affiliate links starting out with no/small audience?**
	-   Might as well, you'll make a few pennies on Amazon, and that's cool. I was using Amazon affiliate links for two years before I started making serious money.
-   **How do you ACTUALLY know what your audience wants to learn when they haven't started asking?**
	-   You put yourself into their mind and you guess, but you can also talk to people in that audience.
	-   If you really have no clue what your target audience wants, then it's probably the wrong audience.
-   **Would it be better to focus in depth on a topic rather than hopping from topic to topic?**
	-   It depends on too many things to answer here.
	-   Most people are beginners at most things, so generally don't go in depth in your videos. Save detail for creating a course.
-   **What's a healthy way to think about how to be collaborative instead of competitive with other creators in a similar niche?**
	-   I think part of it is the mindset that these are collaborators and not competitors, and going away from the idea of competition because that's stupid.
	-   People's behaviour on YouTube isn't to just watch a single channel on a topic. If they are interested in productivity, they will be subscribed to all the main productivity channels. It's not a zero sum game.
-   **How do you decide which idea you will do next?**
	-   Some combination of do I feel like it and will this video do well, so the balance between the personal and business side of it.
-   **How did you learn to summarise ideas/thoughts so succinctly? What process is in your head?**
	-   For the last 14 years I've been teaching people in various capacities, and when you've been doing something for that long you get pretty good at it.
	-   I'm only good at teaching topics I'm familiar with. I'd be really bad at teaching a topic I'm not familiar with.
	-   I try to put myself in the shoes of the person I'm teaching, and try to figure out how I would want it taught to me back in the day when I was a beginner.
-   **Do you have to tell people you are getting money from affiliate links?**
	-   Yes, just mention it in the video description.
